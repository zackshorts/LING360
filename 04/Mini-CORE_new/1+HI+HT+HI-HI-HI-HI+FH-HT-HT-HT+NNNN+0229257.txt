<p> There's a smart thing you can do, too, to prevent the Yahoo! Mail spam filters from becoming a problem themselves. The filters are good, but not perfect, and they can catch a message (newsletters in particular) you do want to receive now and then.
<p> To make sure you don't have to go reading your favorite newsletters in the Bulk folder in Yahoo! Mail, you can set up simple filters that keep it in your Inbox , no matter what. I have created such a filter for the About newsletters , for example.
