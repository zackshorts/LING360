<h> How To Go On A Cheap Date
<p> Enlarge We're going to show you how to date successfully while spending as little money as possible. Dating can be expensive but there are ways to have a memorable night without looking cheap.
<h> Step 1: Use nature
<p> It doesn't cost anything to go to a park, forest, or beach. The beauty of nature creates a romantic setting, even if you aren't feeling romantic. Take a picnic and make it look more expensive by using your best crockery and glasses. If you want to get your date in the mood, there are cheaper aphrodisiacs than oysters. Try avocado, ginger and chocolate.
<h> Step 2: Communicate
<p> Good communication is the most important part of the dating process because new couples need to find out each other's values and interests. Choose activities which will give you plenty of opportunities to communicate. Free museums and art galleries are easy to find in any city. Try a new sport or visit a place you've never been to before to get you both excited and arouse more than your date's interest.
<h> Step 3: Cook
<p> Impress your date by cooking them a meal. To cut down on the cost, buy fresh ingredients from your local market and even borrow cookery books from your local library. Get the adrenalin flowing after the meal by suggesting a competitive game of scrabble. If you decide to go out, take advantage of happy hour. Many pubs, restaurants and cinemas have discounts for less popular times of the day. Taking advantage of this can save you up to 50 per cent of the cost.
<h> Step 4: Pay
<p> If you want to guarantee a second date, you should at least offer to pay for a meal or an evening out. Working out exactly how much your own food and drink costs and only paying for that is the best way to really put your date off.
<h> Step 5: Cheap tickets
<p> If you want to go to a concert or sports event, you don't need to pay the full price. Tickets are often sold at a cheaper price when they first go on sale. Sign up for free ticket alerts from agents such as ticket master so you know when to buy. You could also visit lastminute.com for cheap deals on restaurants, theatres and even theme parks.
