<h> Blood Stain Removal
<p> Blood stains are often only discovered once they've dried into fabrics. If you've ever had a blood stain on your clothes you'll know how hard it is to get out. People often assume that cuts, scrapes and nose bleeds can ruin clothes, however, Vanish Oxi Action is always on hand to make removing blood stains easy.
<h> HOW TO REMOVE BLOOD STAINS
<p> Soaking is recommended in this case - dissolve one scoop of Vanish Oxi Action Powder in 4L of warm water (max 40ø) and soak the stained item. For coloured fabrics, soak for max 1 hour and whites for max 6 hours. Then wash as usual and for best results add one scoop of Vanish to your wash.
<p> Important: Always follow the usage instructions on the Vanish packaging. Do not use on wool, silk or leather. Do not use on finished or coated surfaces -- for example wood, metals etc.
