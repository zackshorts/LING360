<p> What is a bibliography (bib-li-og-ra-phy)?
<p> A bibliography is a list of the books of a specific author or publisher, or on a specific subject.
<p> Why do I need to make a bibliography ?
<p> A bibliography helps you know where you got your information from and it lets your teacher know you are giving proper credit for your sources of information.
<p> What do I include in a bibliography?
<p> You should list every source you use such as a book, a movie, a website, an interview or any information that did not come from you
<p> Where do I put the bibliography for my assignment ?
<p> The bibliography goes at the end of your assignment. The title of this page should be Bibliography or Works Cited
