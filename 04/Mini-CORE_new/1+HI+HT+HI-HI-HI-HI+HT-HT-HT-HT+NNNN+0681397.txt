<h> Relax
<p> If you need help relaxing, contract and release each set of muscles in your body sequentially, starting from your toes and working your way up to your face and scalp.
<p> Step 5
<h> Hold pose
<p> Stay in this pose for as long as you like, letting your whole system relax deeply. Ideally, you will feel like you are falling asleep while remaining fully conscious.
<p> Step 6
<h> Release pose
<p> To release the pose, start by gently wiggling your fingers and toes to reawaken your body. Allow yourself ample time to regain full awareness and movement -- after all, coming back from the dead is no small feat.
<p> Fact
<p> In Hinduism, coming back to life is no big deal -- reincarnation is a central tenet of the religion.
