<h> How to make the most of promotional merchandise and giveaways
<p> 28 August 2012
<p> From tradeshow handouts to prize draws and digital downloads, free gifts can open the door to ongoing engagement and online buzz, says John Manning
<p> Free gifts and giveaways are one of the most enduring tactics used by brands, and it is easy to understand why. No giant leap of faith is required to believe that individuals will think of a business more favourably if they have been given something free.
<p> But how many pens does one person need? How many USB sticks? The logic may be sound, but has over-use made promotional merchandise nothing more than a cheap gimmick? Or can it really bring in new business?
<p> Research carried out by the BPMA (British Promotional Merchandise Association) suggests that it can. The survey found that 56 per cent of respondents felt more favourable towards a brand after receiving a promotional item, while 79 per cent said it would make them more likely to do business with the brand in future.
<p> High Profile managing director Richard Wood says promotional merchandise delivers benefits by keeping a brand front of mind. "Well thought out merchandise hits where it matters," he says. "It will sit on a client's desk, in their pocket, car or bag and be in constant view, acting as a daily reminder of the brand."
<p> Wood says that current trends are for giving away sports bottles, low-cost household and kitchen products -- such as bag clips, measuring scoops and spaghetti measures -- and road safety items. "There will always be seasonal trends, too -- with products such as frisbees, bats and balls and other summer items, and then ice scrapers, Slap Wraps and tyre-tread checkers in the winter," he adds.
<p> With thousands of products available, at a broad range of prices, choices can often feel as if made at random.
<p> What to choose
<p> Haygarth head of promotional and trade Steven Gray says choosing a product that customers will find useful is crucial to the success of this type of giveaway. "Something that lots of businesses do really well in Japan is handing out branded paper fans in summer," he says. "Anything where you have given away something of benefit to the customer, which they will keep with them and use again, gives you quite a low-cost communications channel."
<p> BPMA research into the length of time branded promotional merchandise is kept reveals that low-cost items, such as mugs and pens, can deliver a cost per impression of just œ0.001 -- a tenth of a penny. This compares favourably with other forms of media such as television (œ0.008 per impression) and advertising hoardings (œ0.003 per impression), it says.
<p> But not any old product will do -- no matter how useful. Gray says there must be relevance to the brand. "You need to have permission to be in that space -- otherwise it feels like you're hijacking," he says. "That's always the case, whether you are advertising on Facebook or to B2B (business-to-business) clients on a mouse mat."
<p> Gray gives the example of a promotion for the Batchelors food brand that offered customers the opportunity to win free fuel for a year.
<p> "We did some experiential activity for the campaign, at which we gave away branded car fresheners," he says. "The nature of the promotion gave us a reason to be in that space, and the giveaway enabled us to communicate the brand proposition to people via something they would use time and again."
<p> The sustainability agenda should also influence product choice, says Everything Environmental managing director Evan Lewis. "Client opinion of a company giving away ethically produced or environmentally responsible gifts is without doubt enhanced," he says.
<p> Environmentally friendly products can also be a more cost-effective option, says Lewis. "A re-usable bag may be more expensive than a plastic carrier, but the marketing message will be around longer and the user experience far better. The ROI (return on investment) in this scenario is surely greater, and outweighs the initial cost."
<p> Tradeshow strategy
<p> The dishing out of such branded goodies is a common sight at most B2B industry tradeshows -- where exhibitors must scrap for the attention of visitors.
<p> But Ramarketing owner Raman Sehgal says many businesses are getting it wrong. "You go past stands and they are just giving out random merchandise -- at that level it is very gimmicky," he says. "There should be a strategic approach behind the entire concept of the stand, and all the little bits and bobs, such as promotional merchandise, must fit as part of the overall theme."
<p> SCM Pharma worked with Ramarketing on a strategy for the biggest exhibition in the pharmaceutical contract manufacturing calendar. The stand was developed with a cinema theme in mind -- complementing the business's existing "superhero" brand characters. Popcorn and confectionery were the choice for promotional merchandise.
<p> "We had people from all nine exhibition halls seeking us out to find the smell of popcorn and to grab a bag of sweets," says SCM Pharma managing director Dianne Sharp.
<p> Sehgal says that many exhibition delegates and journalists were complimentary about the creativity of the stand. "I wouldn't say B2B pharma is a dull sector, but it is quite conservative. This sort of thing really stands out," he says.
<p> Pre-event marketing is crucial to tradeshow success, but Sehgal says the real benefit of promotional merchandise is on the day, getting potential customers who have previously never heard of you to visit the stand.
<p> Using popcorn as a giveaway even brought some unforeseen benefits. "At one point, we had the fire safety people over because of smoke from the popcorn machine," says Sehgal. "People thought something was on fire and unintentionally that worked really well, because loads of people came to the stand to see what was going on."
<p> The criteria for assessing the success of the activity were the amount of traffic to the stand and the number of enquiries. "Owing to the nature of our market, sales cycles are very long, so direct business is tricky to assess," says Sharp. But she is confident that  the promotion was a success, and is running the theme again at this year's event.
<p> Measuring ROI
<p> Setting something on fire isn't the only way to make a success of promotional merchandise. And direct ROI can be measured. This is much easier for a different type of promotion -- those that are targeted and require something from the consumer in exchange, usually contact information or part-payment.
<p> APS ran a highly targeted B2B Easter giveaway campaign, promoting its technology solutions to a select group of 50 prospective clients. Crucially, the campaign took engagement beyond the initial freebie.
<p> The potential clients were sent a box of chocolate eggs, with one replaced by an egg timer. They were challenged to play an online game of "find the egg" on a microsite detailing APS Group's IT technology, while using the egg timer to measure how long it took them. They were then invited to enter a prize draw to win a digital camera.
<p> APS Group business services director Ann McLaughlin says that response rates were much higher than industry averages. "There were 65 unique visitors to the microsite, despite the target pool of 50, meaning recipients were sharing the promotion with colleagues."
<p> The promotion also directly contributed to a new business win. "An existing client was impressed with the creative element of the campaign, and we've successfully introduced new creative design services to them -- with a first project worth œ10,000."
<p> Digital channels
<p> In addition to pushing customers online with offline merchandise, measuring response to a promotion can be made significantly easier with new-breed digital giveaways.
<p> These involve people claiming something digitally, such as a free music download, usually in exchange for data that can be ploughed into a customer relationship management system.
<p> James Kilmartin, director of Upfront, says that digital promotions have added benefits rather than just the ease of collecting metrics. "Brands are desperate to develop continuing engagement with consumers, and it is far easier to do that over a digital platform than via any other," he says.
<p> This desire to develop engagement is also influencing the quality of content being given away. "Some of it is really good content because brands are keen for people to engage with it, comment on it, share it and 'like' it," says Kilmartin.
<p> The focus on digital engagement has also led to businesses coming up with new takes on the concept of giveaways. SupersonicAds delivers a service whereby consumers can gain free Facebook credits for watching the duration of online video ads.
<p> While digital giveaways might not be for everyone, using online channels to maximise the reach of a promotion is a must for all brands.
<p> Cement manufacturer Lafarge successfully exploited digital channels, including mobile and social media, when promoting its Big Boys Toys giveaway -- a B2B campaign offering builders and merchants the chance to win experiences such as bungee jumping or driving a tank.
<p> "The potential for using digital and mobile technology, including social media, in the context of promotions is really exciting," says Lafarge marketing manager Mike Lomax. "Normally you would associate this sort of thing with FMCG brands. For a B2B construction industry company, it is uncommon."
<p> The online channels used to promote the Big Boys Toys competition were e-mail, banner ads, social media, QR codes on ads, press releases and leaflets.
<p> "At the time I thought we might get one or two geeky types using the QR codes and that would be it," says Lomax. "We were amazed when we had 366 people accessing the promotion via a QR code."
<p> The e-mail campaign was equally successful, smashing industry benchmarks with a 35 per cent open rate and a click-through rate of 45 per cent.
<p> Lomax is now a convert to digital and mobile promotions. "I get slightly evangelical about this stuff now," he says. "I used to be someone who used very traditional methods, but I'm now convinced by the way digital and mobile communications can work successfully."
<p> Brand value
<p> Promotional merchandise and free giveaways may help brands curry favour with clients, but at what cost? It has long been accepted that discounted pricing strategies run the risk of devaluing a brand -- so can the same be said of freebies?
<p> Up to a point, this does apply, says Gray. "It's not quite the same, but there is still a risk. As with any added value or promotional activity, if a particular tool gets overused then people will come to expect it as part of the norm. It then stops becoming added value and starts becoming integral to the product experience."
<p> The solution, says Gray, is moderation. "Promotions are a great part of the marketing toolkit, but how and when they are used needs to be considered very carefully."
<p> Are your freebies working for you?
<p> You are preparing for your industry's biggest annual tradeshow and have been given a budget to spend on promotional merchandise, so you:
<p> (a) Grab the nearest catalogue and start searching for the wackiest, most attention-grabbing gift you can find.
<p> (b) Stick to mugs, pens and USB sticks. They are tried and tested, and they keep costs low.
<p> (c) Develop an overarching concept for your exhibition activity and purchase merchandise that fits with the theme.
<p> You have just run a successful promotion and consumers are raving about your brand, so you:
<h> CIM training
<h> Dos and don'ts
<p> Do make the giveaway relevant. Irrelevant promotional merchandise risks coming across as overly intrusive, not as a lovely free gift.
<p> Do ask for something in return. Gathering customer data in exchange for the giveaway makes it much easier to quantify the effect of a promotion and put an accurate figure on ROI.
<p> Do continue engagement beyond the free gift. Promotional merchandise makes consumers think of brands more favourably, so don't miss an opportunity to build an ongoing relationship while they are open to your advances.
<p> Don't overuse freebies. Used too frequently, giveaways can devalue your primary service offering or product in the eyes of consumers.
<p> Don't opt for a gimmicky product. It might generate a great reaction initially, but it is unlikely to be of use to the consumer. If they don't use it regularly, you are missing an opportunity to keep your brand front of mind.
<p> Don't neglect digital channels. Even if it is an offline giveaway, an online presence offers customers an opportunity to enthuse about your brand's generosity and to share the promotion with their social networks.
<h> Tips from the top
<p> Gill Thorpe is president of the British Promotional Merchandise Association (BPMA)
<p> 1. Prepare a full brief. The quality and success of any project depends on the quality of the brief. If the supplier understands the business objectives and background, they are more likely to recommend the right product. 2. Consider timing and logistics. The lead time for the campaign needs to be clear from the outset, and the supplier should provide a written schedule of activity, from samples through to delivery. When merchandise is a last-minute affair, the emphasis may turn to what can be achieved and delivered in the time available rather than to the development of the optimal creative solution.
<p> 3. Choose the supplier and product carefully. With thousands of suppliers out there vying for the business, it is important to select one with a good reputation, experience and long-term relationships with manufacturers and suppliers. Nearly 70 per cent of senior marketers use their current supplier as their top source of information.
<p> 4. Don't buy on price. Senior marketers view practicality, relevance to the brand and attractiveness to the target audience as the crucial factors to consider when selecting the most effective item of merchandise. The budget is a major factor, but it shouldn't be at the expense of product choice or quality of service.
<p> 5. Consider ethics, the environment and relevant legislation or guidelines. Many companies source products from overseas to take advantage of the price and flexibility other countries can offer. However, it is important to be aware that there are risks involved. Choose a supplier that has stringent and transparent ecological and social responsibility credentials and that adheres to any necessary requirements, such as the CE Mark for products targeted at children.
