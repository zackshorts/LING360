<p> The two Steves, Jobs and Wozniak, built the Apple brand on its synergy between hardware and software. 25 years on, you pay a premium for that.
<p> It's œ599 for the cheapest Mac Mini. œ1999 for an entry level Mac Pro. But since 2006, new Macs have had a very similar internal architecture to Windows PCs. The same Intel CPUs, the same Nvidia graphics.
<p> Since then, people have been hacking together Macs in their bedrooms. They call them Hackintoshes; PCs that run OS X for a fraction of the price of a brand new Mac. My aim was build the cheapest, usable Hackintosh possible.
<p> Basic hardware configuration
<p> Forget all about bells and whistles like Blu-Ray and 5.1 surround sound. I wanted to get a basic system up and running with the barest of necessities.
<p> I needed to choose a motherboard and compatible CPU, DVD drive, a SATA hard drive, 2GB of RAM and a video card. All were picked to fit nicely into the ATX case of my choice and most of the components were bought on eBay. This was my build:
<p> There were other things I had to take into consideration, though. I had to design the machine, I had to put it together and then I had turn it into a Mac...
<p> CASE STUDY: The ATX case I chose shows you what the final Hackintosh looks like. It's not quite a Mac Pro...
<p> Compatible hardware
<p> Thank ye olde Gods for the OSx86 Hardware Compatibility Lists (HCLs). In fact, thank them for the entire OSx86 Wiki - a must bookmark for wannabe Hackintosh builders. I picked out the components for my build based on the experiences posted there, cross checking with the HCLs for potential pitfalls.
<p> CHECKLIST: It's essential you check drives, cards and motherboards against OSx86 Hardware Compatibilty Lists, or your custom Mac project may never get off the ground
<p> Another way to make sure your system will run OS X is to use someone else's tried and tested build. At the time of writing, the build I've listed above is running Snow Leopard 10.6.4 and - for the most part - it works. There are many other Hackintosh build guides available, though. Here are some other build resources I'd recommend taking a look at:
<p> Insanely Mac is the community flipside of OSx86 with a message board where users exchange advice. They also post full hardware build details, which is very handy if you don't know where to start. Check out the Tutorials section.
<p> Then there are a series of builds at tonymacx86 . They're all centred around Gigabyte P55 series motherboards. tonymacx86.jpeg - tonymacx86 Blog started as a document of the author's specific build. Now it's a general resource for Intel based custom Mac projects. Handily, Tony also provides downloads for boot tools and an OS X installer. More on those in a moment.
