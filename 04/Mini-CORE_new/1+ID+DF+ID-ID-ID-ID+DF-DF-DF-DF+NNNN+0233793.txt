<p> Is this any different to a Blizzard card? Can't see any fans on it so assume it just goes in the trapdoor slot and won't have to worry about ventalation? _________________ Owned: Amiga 1200 2mb + 8mb fast, 4gb HD, WHD Load Playstation 2, Nintendo DS, Nintendo Wii
<p> Yes, fans and ventilation are a new thing in technology. When everything ran sub 25 mhz there was no need for fans. In this case we are talking about a two chip memory card; so there is ZERO need for cooling. Just plugs straight in - just as all good Amiga products should.
<p> On the down side this is just a ram board, if you want power go for a CPU board, like the Blizzard 1230 IV!
<p> The big difference, as has been mentioned is that it's not an accelerator card. Just a RAM card. Now, just having FAST RAM speeds up your Amiga, so it's does make things faster, but it's not a faster CPU.
<p> That said, I had a RAM card for quite a while and it worked great.
<p> 1 thing (and it's mentioned in the post) is that it's not PCMCIA friendly with 8M.
<p> That means, you can't use this card with an 8M SIMM (which it looks like it comes with) and use the PCMCIA slot on Kickstart 3.1.
