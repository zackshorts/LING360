<p> Bureaucracy gone mad, sent my guys out to do a maintenance job on a local shop in out in two hours. Perspex panels x 2 and 12 6 ft tubes what could go wrong. Well we invested in a boss tower a few years back and often use it on thease types of jobs in stead of ladders, we all have our pasma training in place and it is a great safe way to do jobs like this. Today just as the tower was in place a member of the council approched us and insisted we stopped working as we didnt have a licence for our scaffolding. We use a snap up instead of a ladder we are in and out in a few hours we are taking up no more space than ladders. œ100 fee and œ100 deposit in case we damage the street furniture. I agree fixed perminant scaffolding errected to re roof a building that may be in place for a few weeks would fall into this licencing requirement but we are changing a few flouresent lamps...
<p> I find myself doing more of this type of work early in the morning, late in the evening, or on a weekend!
<p> I've been asked a number of times 'have you received permission to block the pavement and divert the public onto the highway", I have a few ex service barriers which I corrall people around with - if need be, I've so far just said yes, my boss dealt with it, and been gone before they got back!!!! one day it'll bit me I guess but, Like you say, for removing a couple of panels and changing a few lights / electrical components where necessary... it's madness.
<p> I once needed a method statement, risk assessment and proof of œ3 million insurance to be allowed to change the tubes in a menu case (4x3') at eye level in a shopping centre...out of hours.
<p> Many years ago - I once had a member of the public screaming at me (from his back garden) whilst 100 foot in the air on the hub platform of a ferris wheel fitting signs for not having a hi-vis jacket or helmet on.
<p> We do a lot of city centre work on shops and I'm constantly banging on whoever is with me at the time. Safety first, hi-vis, barriers, good housekeeping etc. Not only good working practice, but more often than not, the CCTV operators spend their time with cameras trailed on us!
<p> Not had too many jobsworths. Even the traffic wardens can be appeased in most cities by calling their head office and getting dispensation to overstay in parking bays.
<p> I got a parking ticket on a council car park once where i was fitting new council car park signs the idiot even watched me fitting them whilst issuing the ticket i just said no worries i will add the price of the ticket to the invoice!!

<p> get a blue badge George, that way you don't have problems with parking generally
