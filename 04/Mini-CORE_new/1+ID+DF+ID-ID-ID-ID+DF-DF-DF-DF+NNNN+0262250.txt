<h> Reply By Email extension for Projectfork 3.0.x.
<p> Reply By Email is a Joomla 1.7, 2.5 plugin that will enable users to reply to comments and discussions directly from their inbox! No longer will you need to log into Projectfork to reply to a posted comment!
<p> The Reply By Email extension requires that your hosting account is configured with php-imap and iconv . To ensure that you meet the criteria we have prepared a simple script which you can download from here , unzip and upload to your hosting account's root folder. Once uploaded navigate to http://your-domain/checkcompat.php . If you receive a success message you are right to go!
<p> I believe that you should probably be offering a different file for Outlook 2003 and Outlook 2007. Alternatively I believe that offering updating calendars only for Outlook 2007/2010 would be acceptable, I've noticed that other sites do this.
<p> Downloading the Calendar does work, but for project management based stuff I'd say it's useful if the calendar does an automatic update.
