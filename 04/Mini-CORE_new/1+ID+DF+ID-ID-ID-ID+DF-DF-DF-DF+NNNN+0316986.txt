<p> It sounds stragely like my usb writing problem. It's either power or usb drivers that cause it, ot a combination of thr two. Either way, you're stuck with the external drive, which I assume is powered.
<p> These usb sticks see to be very power hungry when intensive reading/writing to them.
<p> Might do the trick, I don't know. I tried an iPad adapter (rated at 2A iirc) and it did increase the time until failure, but it still failed. However, I was copying data to the usb stick on the Pi through the network so this could have been another problem as the usb and ethernet connections share the same bus.
