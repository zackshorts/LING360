<p> Do you think is it possible to use the internal wifi chipset like AP and client at the same time??? I don't even know if is it possible in Linux...but I do it in windows 7 every day with applications like virtual router or connectify...
<p> is it possible to use the internal wifi chipset like AP and client at the same time?
<p> No. There are two different versions of the firmware, one for AP, one for Client, you choose which one to load and then you are stuck with it until a reboot.

<p> No you don't. AP Mode requires support in the WiFi device itself, it has nothing to do with Windows or Windows drivers.
<p> If you run the Guruplug in Client mode you can (obviously) connect to access points. It should also be possible to connect to other WiFi Clients (google Ad-Hoc Mode) providing they also support Ad-Hoc point-to-point.
