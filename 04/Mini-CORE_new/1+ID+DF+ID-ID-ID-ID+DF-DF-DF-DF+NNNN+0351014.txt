<p> Congratulations and enjoy your honeymoon in Africa. Have I got a couple of african vacation stories for you...But alas, you'll have to wait for the book I'm writing. Plus, I wouldn't want to scare you off your trip. Just be glad I'm not coming with you.
<p> Mrs Durro and I are coming up to our 20th anniversary - just booked a 13 day cruise to Fiji to celebrate it.
