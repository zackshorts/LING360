<h> How do i get out of it
<p> I found myself betting futball matches online after a friend introduced it to me. I thought i would win because i love futball, only to find out that the more i bet the more i lose, and i cant just quit because ive lost some money, and most of my friends do it... Am a student, its disattracting me from my studies. Am feldup with it, but i just cant stop.. What do i do?
