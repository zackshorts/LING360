<p> Unless of course it is an attempt a joke! That must be it. It seems to be lacking a couple of elements to be a joke though. Being funny is the first one. Original being the other. A "woman parking a car" joke. My God, it really is still the 1970s in some places isn't it.

<p> I love a sense of humor that's moved with the times.it always amazet me what "with the times is" is it the new age comics that would stand on one leg and shout A@se.or is that a bit 80s Or is it the up and coming comedy that's based on gags writen by,Miller,galton and simpson or even the late great Monkhouse & Goodwin,Gerald Wiley and many many others.
