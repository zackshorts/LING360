<p> Stuffed animals are timeless classics for little children, even for older children. Although they are so cute, they get neglected at times. Love your stuffed animal a lot and you can't get a pet? Well, here's the article for you!
<p> Give your stuffed animal a name . You need a personal nickname to call it. This will make your stuffed animal feel important. Take a look at your stuffed animal. Is it a rabbit? Try Fluffy perhaps. An even-cream color? Then make a name that includes two of its characteristics, like Fluffy Cream, Striped Tiger, or Monkey Brown.

<p> Buy your stuffed animal some friends . Although you may think "They're stuffed. They don't need any friends!" They do, because it will be cute if they had some friends to "hang out" with. Besides, the more the merrier!

<p> Buy your stuffed animal a little bag or carrying case that you can bring it in . It will also be great if you bought each one of your stuffed animals something to carry them in also. Get small luggage - just enough to add its small clothes and accessories. Try toy stores or garage sales, where you can get some cheap things.
<p> 4
<p> Think of some games you like . Play some of them like checkers, or chess with him/her.
<p> 5
<p> Make your stuffed animal a small "house ." You can put a small pillow and washcloth inside a shoe box. You can also try getting some mini-furniture for your pet so it can lounge around. However, nobody likes living alone, so get a mini-pet for your toy!
<p> 6
<p> Play with your toy . Give your toy lots of play time so they don't get bored.
<p> 7
<p> Give your stuffed animal lots of love . Read them stories, watch movies with them, share meals, etc. And don't forget, even stuffed animals are a little afraid of the dark, so they might want to cuddle with you at night.
<p> 8
<p> Vacuum or clean them regularly . Your poor toy may be covered with gross lint from over-playing with it. When you vacuum your stuffed animal, it removes their dust and dirt. It's like an air shower! Are they way too dirty for vacuuming? Don't worry -- you can give your toy a bath by putting it in the washing machine, or you can hand wash it yourself. Just be sure to read the washing instructions for your toy.
<p> 9
<p> Get or make your stuffed animal some clothes or accessories for it . Nobody wants a naked toy! The best store to buy clothes will be toy stores or places that let you make a bear/stuffed toy.
<p> 10
<p> Stitch them up when needed . If they have a cut or tear, stitch them up. If you don't know how, ask around your family and friends. It's kind of like going to the doctor's for stuffed animals.
<p> 11
<p> Have stuffed animal parties with your friends ! Your friends most likely have some stuffed animals, too, so your toy can make some new friends at a party.
<p> If you lose your stuffed animal, look for him/her everywhere and anywhere. If there is no luck say goodbye and blow a kiss to him/her.
<p> Also, if you lose your friend, you can always get a new one and start all over! Who knows? You might find your teddy someday, so don't lose hope!
<p> If you want to make a bed, here's an idea: Get something like a small beanbag for a pillow. For the blanket you can use an old bandana or have your stuffed animal sleep bare.
<p> When you're at the store, choose a stuffed animal that looks like you'd have a good time with. If you see something that looks like you'd lose interest in later don't get it!
<p> One tip one making clothes for your stuffed friend is to make a small rectangular pouch/purse with no closing at the top, and then you add a semi-circular closing. Then add two ribbons at the sides to make a cute lil' backpack EASILY!
