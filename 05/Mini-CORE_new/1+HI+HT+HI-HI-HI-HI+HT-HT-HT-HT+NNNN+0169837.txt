<h> How to make the best popcorn EVER
<p> November 5, 2012
<p> Man I love popcorn, it's such a great snack... not to mention a great vehicle for enjoying masses of butter. We eat popcorn all the time -- not only is it fun to eat, it's five minutes of entertainment or Alfie, who loves to listen to the kernels pop-pop-popping. Anyway, I think I have finally nailed the method, so I thought I should share it with y'all. This recipe makes enough for me and, well, I suppose you can have some, Alfie...
<p> Apparently you can store it in a glass jar, but as I never, ever leave a single piece uneaten, I can't vouch for that. If you can, buy organic popping corn from your health-food shop. You will need an oil with a high smoke-point, such as rice bran, canola or coconut. I find sunflower works the best.
<p> Heat two tablespoons of oil in a stainless steel, medium-sized saucepan with a lid. Chuck in two kernels of corn. When these fellas have popped, remove the pan from the heat and add 1/4 cup popping corn and cover with lid. Count 20 green elephants then put the pan back onto the heat. The corn should start popping almost straight away and go nuts for about 20 seconds. When it stops popping, quickly remove the lid and tip popcorn into a colander. Chuck a hefty knob of low-salt butter into the hot pan and swirl it round to melt, then pour this and the popcorn into a bowl. Drizzle with two teaspoons of runny honey and stir until the popcorn is coated in the sweet-savoury yumness.
<p> Lock children in bedroom and enjoy while watching something trashy on TV. Or, in my real life, gobble it down while sitting on the deck, shooting the breeze.
<p> YUMMY! Tried it and it was awesome! My husband loved it too (although kids did not like stickiness -- better for me! hehe) After cooking popcorn I poured it out then added butter and raw honey (since it's not pourable) to the hot pot. Stirred until all melted together, then added popcorn and stirred until coated. Thanks for sharing!
