<h> Ways to leave a gift in your Will
<p> We know that your first priority when making a Will is to provide for your loved ones. Many people find that even after they've done this they can leave a gift in their Will to charity.
<p> Leaving a gift in your Will is one of the most valuable and lasting ways you can support the Red Cross. There are a number of different ways you can remember the Red Cross in your will, depending on your circumstances.
<h> You can leave a share of your estate
<p> A good way to help is to leave a proportion, or the whole of what is left in your estate after you have provided for your loved ones. This type of gift (known as a residuary bequest) is easy to add to an existing Will without interfering with any specific sums you have left to family or friends. It also has the advantage that it will not be eroded in value by inflation over the years. Just 1, 2, 5% or more of your estate can make a difference.
<h> You can leave a fixed sum of money
<p> You may wish to leave us a fixed sum of money (known as a pecuniary bequest). Please remember that this type of gift does not allow for changes in your circumstances or inflation.
<h> You can leave a specific item of value
<p> You may wish to leave us a particular item (known as a specific bequest), which can be sold to support our work. It could be property or an item of value such as real estate, art or a piece of jewellery.
<p> The following are examples of specific wording recommended for leaving a gift in your Will to Red Cross. In all cases, the most important thing is your own peace of mind so we encourage you to discuss your Will with your legal advisor.
<p> To include Australian Red Cross in you Will, you could include the following:
<p> To donate a percentage of your estate: "I give to Australian Red Cross (ABN 50 169 561 394), for its general purposes, free of all duties % of my residuary estate for which an authorised receipt from Australian Red Cross will be a sufficient discharge for the executor(s) or trustee."
<p> or
<p> "I give to Australian Red Cross (ABN 50 169 561 394), for its general purposes, free of all duties the whole of the residue of my estate for which an authorised receipt from Australian Red Cross will be a sufficient discharge for the executor(s) or trustee."
