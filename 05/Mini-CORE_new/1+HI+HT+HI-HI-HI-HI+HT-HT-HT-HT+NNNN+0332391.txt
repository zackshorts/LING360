<p>  Avoid hair-colouring products during pregnancy . Most have health warnings on them advising against use by pregnant women.
<p>  Eat organic food wherever possible. At the very least buy organic broccoli and grapes in place of non-organic broccoli and grapes. Broccoli and grape crops tend to make high use of pesticides. They also have a large edible surface area, which increases the amount of pesticide residue you finally eat.
<p>  Limit your consumption of tuna , fish that dwell on the sea floor and shellfish.
<p>  Eat free-range, organic chicken and eggs. Non-organic chickens are often fed synthetic hormones and antibiotics to improve their growth and avoid diseases. Exposure to synthetic hormones can confuse the development of the reproductive organs, while the antibiotics in the chicken and eggs can depress both the mother's and child's immune systems.
<p>  Quit smoking (if you are a smoker) and avoid smoky environments. Cigarette smoke is a cocktail of toxic, unhealthy chemicals that are particularly dangerous to both children and pregnant women. Smoking is linked with low-birth-weight babies and increases the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).
