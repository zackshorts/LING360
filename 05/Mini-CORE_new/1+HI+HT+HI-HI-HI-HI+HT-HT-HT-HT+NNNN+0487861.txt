<h> How To Come Up With A Band Name Fans Will Dig In 6 Steps
<p> If you've been wondering how to come up with a band name, look no further. Within this article I will walk you step by step to getting a good band name for your group. All I ask is that you read down to the bottom to make sure the process runs as smoothly as possible, and if you find it useful you share this article with other bands.
<p> So, let's get into it.
<h> Using A Band Name Generator
<p> Ok, so I'm going to start with the easiest option available to you: Create your band name using a random band name generator . A band name generator is a free tool which can be used by anyone to create a name for their band. How they work is simple. You simply load up the page the tool is on (It loads as fast as any other internet page), then click on the 'Generate Band Name' button. You will then be given a random band name which you can see if you like or not.
<p> If you like the suggested name, you can add it to your list of potential names you could use. If not, simply click the Generate Band Name button again and a new random name will appear.
<p> A quick word of warning; As the words are created at random, you will get a lot of unique names that haven't been used anywhere else before. That said, the tool may occasionally create a name that already exists. It's because of this that you should do your own research once you've found a name that you like, and make sure no one else is already using it. If they are, click to generate a new name.
<p> This is no reason not to use a band name generator however, as even when you think of a new name by yourself, you could still accidentally pick a name that is already in use by someone else. No matter how you go about picking your band name, you should always do your research on it before you finalize your choice.
<p> If you decide against using a band name generator to pick your good or funny band name, there are a few other options.
<h> Use Words Personal To You
<p> One great way to make sure you pick a band name you will be happy with, is to incorporate words that have some kind of meaning to you already. This could be in terms of a road you live on, the name of a childhood sweet heart, or even your favorite type of chocolate bar.
<p> Using those examples, you could use the area 'Brixton' to create the band name 'Brixton Bears', your childhood sweetheart 'Amy' to create 'Amy And The Bricks', or your favorite chocolate bar 'Twix' to create 'Twix Tales'.
<p> You can do this with any word that has any meaning to you. If you're not picking the name by yourself, you can also use words that are relevant to all of you. For example, if you met on the website 'Gumtree', you could call yourself 'Gums For A Tree'.
<h> Brain Storm Random Words For Your Band Name
<p> One final way to come up with a band name is to brainstorm random words. They could be words you just think sound cool, or they could be words based on whatever comes to your mind at the time. It doesn't matter how silly or boring you think they are, just get them down.
<p> You can either brain storm words together (E.G. 'Fuzzy Boo') or you can do them as singular words; just whatever comes to your head at the time. The important thing though, is that you write all these randoms names and words down.
<p> When you got a page or so of words and ideas, the next step is to look over this page. You may find that most of the names aren't suitable, but you may also find that some are actually quite good. From here you can either pick a band name, or if none are suitable, get to work on modifying some of the ideas with potential.
<p> So say for example one of your ideas was 'Metal Hog'. You like the 'Metal' part and that the next words begins with a 'H', but you don't like the word 'Hog'. From here you can think of a replacement word that you would find more suitable. List down a load of words that begin with H that sound good after Metal, and after pick the best one.
<p> By the end you should have one or two main ideas you want to use. If not though, rinse and repeat with any other ideas with potential.
<p> Once you've done this and have a name you like, there are still a few things you need to do before you confirm and decide on that name.
<h> Checking No One Else Has That Band Name Already
<p> The first thing you need to do when you have a name or two you like and could see yourself using, is to check if there any other bands with the same name out there. Having the same name as another band is not really acceptable, as you want to make sure people can easily know it's you when your name gets mentioned. You also want to set yourself apart from the rest by having a cool and unique name....
