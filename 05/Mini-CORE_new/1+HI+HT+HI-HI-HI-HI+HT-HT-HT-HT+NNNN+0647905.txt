<p> Portfolios represent you -- who you are, what you have done, what you hope to do. A good portfolio tells reviewers not just about your accomplishments, but about the way you think about your life and goals.
<p> Planning Your Portfolio Creating a portfolio is not an easy task. It's not just a collection of documents, and artifacts thrown into a binder with each item labeled; it requires a lot of planning to design a exemplary portfolio.
<p> First - what do you want the portfolio to say about you? You want your portfolio's readers to develop a greater understanding of you, and why you would be an asset to the program you're applying to.
<p> Second -- what will you include in your portfolio that represents you at your best?Third -- should your portfolio be a two-dimensional hard copy submitted in a binder or a case, in a digitized and electronic form, or a combination of the two?
<p> What To Include in Your Portfolio A visual arts portfolio should demonstrate your accomplishments and skills. Requirements for your portfolio vary from university to university. Here is a general guide:
<p>  15 -- 20 separate works from three different categories:  observational art - drawing or painting in a traditional way using a still life, model, portrait or landscape as accurately as possible  personal art -- art done outside class that reflects your own interests in materials, subject, and concept  required art -- check with the school you are applying to see if you must create a specific work as part of your portfolio  works from different media that you have worked with, including drawings, colour explorations, photographs, computer images and design work  original work may be included if it is not too large, heavy or fragile  finished and unfinished work, such as sketchbook and other preliminary work  three-dimensional work, such as sculptures, may be included in the form of photographs of the work  videos may be sent if they are short [usually no longer than 3 minutes].
<p> Portfolios must include an itemized list of all submitted work, describing each work's medium, dimensions and year of completion. Since you are submitting your own original work, include a statement of originality and confidentiality to make sure that no one makes unauthorized duplicates of your work.
<p> How to Include Items in Your Portfolio Slides and other photographic formats are the best way to submit your work. When you are taking your photographs, be sure to do this:  use a 35mm camera with manual operation  photograph your work on a solid white or solid black background, depending on the artwork  take your photographs outside if possible, as it produces even lighting; if you must photograph inside, use photoflood bulbs for lighting
<p> If you are using slides, be sure to keep a master set of slides if you need to make duplicates to send to other schools. Label the slides with your name, and the date, title and dimensions of the work. Photographs should be similarly labeled.
<p> Most schools will accept photographs of your work in .tif, .psd, or .jpg formats on a CD or a DVD submitted as part of your portfolio. If you are submitting a video, you should submit it on the CD or DVD in a common format such as QuickTime or Windows Media Video; the file name should include your name.
<p> Other Items to Include In Your Portfolio Your portfolio can also include your resume, your extracurricular activities, and any prizes and awards you have won for your work.
<p> The Physical Format of the Portfolio Your portfolio should be displayed in a three-ring binder or a zippered case. Any printed items you include must be inserted into labeled plastic sheet protectors. Sections showing different kinds of work can be separated and organized using dividers with labeled tabs. A CD or DVD should be inserted into a protective cover and then placed in its own plastic sheet.
<p> It helps to include a table of contents, showing where each sample of work can be found. Don't forget that reviewers look at many portfolios; make your portfolio as easy to read as possible!
<p> Ensuring Your Portfolio Is Returned When you submit your portfolio, send it in a strong, reusable container with enough return postage so that it can be returned to you; otherwise you will not get your portfolio back.
<p> A great portfolio is hard work, but it's worth it if it wins you admission to the university of your choice!
