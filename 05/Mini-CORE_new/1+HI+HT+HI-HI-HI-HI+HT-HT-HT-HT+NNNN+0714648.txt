<h> How to Create a PDF Form That Can Be Filled Out Online
<p> Written by jacob stover | Translated by ehow contributor
<p> PDF files are proprietary document files for use with the Adobe Acrobat suite of programs. PDF forms offer rich content creation and arrangement options, and can be used for a number of different purposes. In order to create a form which can be filled out online, you'll need a copy of Adobe Acrobat Standard or Pro. Creating a form using these programs is very simple, and should take only a few moments
<p> Skill level:
<p> Moderately Easy
<h> Instructions
<h> Things you need
<p> Adobe Acrobat Standard or Pro
<p> 1
<p> Open Adobe Acrobat, and select the "Forms" task button.
<p> 2
<p> Select an appropriate template from the list, or select "start from scratch".
<p> 3
<p> Select all valid fields using the "Form Editting Mode" wizard which will automatically open a prompt when a new project is started. This will help Acrobat determine which fields will receive text entry and which ones will remain static.

<p> Right-click any field in your template or blank document to bring up a context menu for that field. Select "Properties" from the context menu to enter or change text, or to add additional settings to your text fields.
