<p> Here's a quick how-to guide on how you can track email to it's originating location by figuring out the email's IP address and looking it up. I have found this to be quite useful on many occasions for verification purposes since I receive lots of emails daily due to my blog. Tracking the IP address of an email sender does require looking at some technical details, so be ready to dig your heels in!
<p> There are basically two steps involved in the process of tracking an email : find the IP address in the email header section and then look up the location of the IP address.
<h> Finding the IP address of an email sender in GMail, Yahoo Mail, and Outlook
<p> Let's go ahead and take a look at how you would do this for Google, Yahoo and Outlook since those are the most popular email clients.
<p> Google's Gmail
<p> 1. Log into your account and open the email in question.
<p> 2. Click on the down arrow that's to the right of the Reply link. Choose Show Original from the list.
<p> Now here's the technical part that I was telling you about earlier! You need to look for the lines of text that start with " Received: from ". It might be easier to simply press Cntrl + F and perform a search for that phase. You'll notice that there are several Received From's in the message header. This is because the message header contains the IP addresses of all of servers involved in routing that email to you.
<p> To find the first computer that originally sent the email, you'll have to find the Received From that's farthest DOWN . As you can see from the above image, the first one is from a computer called "aseem" with the IP address 72.204.154.191 . Then it was routed to my ISP's server at eastrmmtao104.cox.net and so on and so forth till it got to your email server.
<p> The computer aseem is my personal home computer and that's my public IP address for my house! I'll go through Yahoo and Outlook before talking about tracking the location of that IP address.
<p> Yahoo Mail Beta
<p> 1. Log into your account and open the email (if you're using Yahoo Mail Beta with the new preview interface, make sure you double-click on the email so that it opens in a new tab)
<p> 2. At the top right, you'll see there is a drop-down option where Standard Header is selected by default.
<p> 3. Click on it and choose Full Header .
<p> Again, you'll see the same information as before, just in a different window:
<p> Microsoft Outlook
<p> 1. Open the email in Outlook by double-clicking on it
<p> 2. Go to View at the top menu (the menu options for the email, not the main Outlook window) and choose Options .
<p> You'll get a dialog box where you can set the message options and at the bottom you'll see the Internet Headers box. For some silly reason, the box is very small and you have to scroll a lot, so it's best to simply copy and paste the text into Notepad to view it more easily.
<h> Tracking the location of an IP address
<p> Now that we have our originating IP address of 72.204.154.191, let's find out where that is! You can do this by perform a location lookup on the IP address. My favorites are IP2Location and GeoBytes IP Locator .
<p> GeoBytes gave me a big map of New Orleans, LA along with a bunch of other information about the location itself.
<p> IP2Location also gave me the same information pretty much, including the ISP (Cox Communications). Of course, this is correct since I live in New Orleans!
<p> If you want more information, you can do a WHOIS database search also. My favorite one is the Network Solutions . This will give you information on who hosts that IP address and their registration information. You can always contact them to try and find more information on that particular IP address.
<p> Have fun tracking down those emails! Questions, comments, or suggestions? Post a comment!
<p> but thats only if the sender used a mail client on his own computer. if the sender uses gmail.com web interface to send the mail, u'll just see googles server in the "recieved: from" section. not useful!
<p> I agree it's not useful if the email is sent from Gmail via a web browser. However, there are tons of people who send emails from their office computers (Outlook, etc) and in those cases, tracking the location would be useful!
<p> Lexx -- "In fact, the only part of the email header that can't be faked is the Received: line, which references your mail server. Spammers often add spoofed Received: headers to try to hide the true origin of the unwanted email, but modern mail transfer programs record the sender's correct IP address. So even if the sender uses a fictitious or false name when contacting the receiving server, you can determine the origin of the spoofed message."
<p> Well done! This may not work all the time as others have said. But Ive had success in using these procedures in tracking down businesses who have gotten my email from other websites, such as when you use a directory submittal site.
<p> Thanks for the positive comments! I wasn't meaning this to be a super comprehensive guide to detect the location of spam email. Mostly I've used this to track down emails from malicious businesses or individuals. Most of them don't even know how to spoof an IP address!
<p> [...] -How to track the original location of an email via its IP address Here's a quick how-to guide on how you can track email to its originating location by figuring out the email's IP address and looking it up. [...]
<p> When going for spammers, I generally look up the IP of the smtp server and report 'em. I find that lots of people nowadays use webmails, and that doesn't accurately report the IP address of the sender. Nice tip though
<p> Even if you have got a genuine IP I can't really see how useful knowing the location of the ISP is anyway. No ISP is going to tell you which of their users was using 'x' IP address on 'x' date at 'x' time anyway.
<p> For example, if I sent you an email from where I am and you looked the IP up it would tell you I'm in Ipswich, UK. I am, however, about 40 miles from there, how useful is this?
<p> If I use outlook express as the default mail and also have access to webmail. My laptop PC is at work but I am replying my emails from another PC. Can the Administrator find out from what PC I am replying to my emails? Remember is an external PC and using an external site to check emails. Please advise. Thanks
<p> I think i'm a little late in posting my comments (the blog appeared in October & I'm posting my comment in December). The article is really interesting but you have not mentioned how to track an email received on a hotmail account. I want to track an email that I received on my hotmail account but I don't know how to do it. Someone had told me that I should go to the "options", click "message display settings" and i'll find full headers there. But i couldn't find any "message display settings", so there's no way to find full headers. is there a way to track such a mail? how can this be done?
<p> How can I retrieve an email posted a couple years ago and no longer on my pc. Isn't there a public repository of these email posts? I did a search once (don't even remember what I queried) and pulled up email messages from several people to others. These were private emails to a party I was not privy to. I need to retrieve some emails that may involve possible posts that indicate wrongdoing if this is possible.
<p> Great post, very informative.....I also liked your recent posts about wireless security, its amazing how many people are blissfully unaware how many malicious companies and hackers are constantly trying to steal information...
<p> hey aseem i was just wondering if i could track some one sending from gmail and i also recieving it from gmail ..i ther a way because your thing i tried and didnt work ...there was no recieved from...can u help me
<p> some people here criticize as if they are the brightest people on earth. Come on this guy is just sharing his knowledge. If you find the article not useful to you it does not mean it has no use to every person who will read. full of boastful people generation.
<p> can you tell me, if i have an IP address from a year ago, but still saved it..can you still figure out where the computer was that it came from, I am told IP addresses change withing hours/minutes and it's no longer trackable?
<p> I have had the same Yahoo email for 20 years, +or-, when I pull down the arrow to the right of "REPLY" I only have two choices. Reply to Sender or Reply to Everyone I do not know what to do next. Would you help me please. Your article was most informative and I could actually understand some of it. Thanking you in advance, Teri 865.556.9246 Notify me any way its convenient for you.
<p> for outlook express 6 you must double click on the email then click on file then click properties. when that box comes up click the details tab then click message source and maximize the browser. this will avoid the copy/paste that the blog host spoke about up above.
<p> There are three places that say received. i chose the second one from mine to track but maybe you coukld try all three. It may be that it brings you all to the same place and maybe not. have fun and thanks for allowing me to add my two cents worth.
<p> Is there anyway at all of being able to find out an IP address from just an email addy alone (no email header)? I received a message thru an online auction site's messaging system, so naturally the IP addy shows up as that of the auction site. The only info I have is the members email addy
<p> Thanks for this write up. I received a spam mail and tried using your instruction to trace it. I did trace it and found out it came from a university. The "Whois" ip gave me information about my university network. So, I couldn't trace further to the particular building or address within the university. How can I trace this further to the original origin.
<p> hey ! very interesting blog , i m using hotmail account and i want to know how to track an email received on a hotmail account. I want to track an email that I received on my hotmail account but I don't know how to do it. Someone had told me that I should go to the "options", click "message display settings" and i'll find full headers there. But i couldn't find any "message display settings", so there's no way to find full headers. is there a way to track such a mail? how can this be done?
<p> I find this very interesting real or not. I had a WEBTV and if I were to press forward I could easily see the IP listed but I now I switched to MSNTV2 and I can't do it anymore. Does anyone have any ideas?
<p> I've been developing on a lot of geo tracking reports based on IP address for the email list manager @ listrocket.com. There are a few good ip info services out there and I would recommend ipmango.com for quick lookups. If you want to automate ip lookups, check out the api @ maxmind.com. Both are free services for online ip lookups.
<p> The only downside is that if someone uses web-based mail, then the IP geo data can be inaccurate as it will show the web-mail server IP address.
<p> well, I don't know if this has ever happened. I got 2 different locations on an ip. one from IPLocation and a different one from geobytes. Maybe you can help me figure out the correct one. the IP is 81.199.56.252. One gives Isreal as a location and the other gives Maryland as the other location.
<p> I used both sites (geobytes.com/IpLocator.htm?GetLocation)\\... IP2Location (ip2location.com/free.asp) to find the location of an ISP. Both came up with different locations for the same numbers. The 1st and 3rd are from IP2 and the 2nd and 4th are from Geobytes. Why would they have such different readings?
<p> Can someone help me please i have a huge dilema and i dont know what to do.
<p> Long story but here goes.
<p> A few nights ago i sent a friend of mine a very long and extremely personal email. It was from my hotmail account to his hotmail account. An hour later the email i sent him was forwarded from his email account to everyone in his friends list. He is now accusing me of hacking into his account and forwarding the email myself. I DIDNT DO THIS! He says he has friends who know about computers and that he can prove the message i sent him and the forwarded message to his friends both came from my ip address hence i must have done it. He said he went into my original email, right clicked and went down to "view source" and that gave him the ip address of the computer i sent the original email from. He then said he went into the email that was forwarded from his hotmail account and did the same thigs ie. right clicked and "view source" and said that the ip adresses matched so i had to have hacked into his hotmail account and forwarded the message myself. My query is if someone has hacked into my friends hotmail account and forwarded my message how difficult would it be to make it seem it had come from my computer and my ip address? My friend is saying he can prove it was me but it wasnt and im so upset now. Not only are we not talking anymore but he is now threatening to take this further and get police etc involved.
<p> There's never a question of whether ISPs Want to divulge their client's IPs, they are all listed in one WHOIS database or another, so it's not really a "well, they won't tell" issue. And if a person does ghost their IP, just do a simple tracer -t or pathping -i and follow the source path that way, the real IP will show. Spammers and misusers of email services really stand no chance nowadays, just find their IP out and locate it on a WHOIS database depending on where their location is, and then contact the ISP or other local authorities and their gone. If only more people actually knew and did these things instead of chucking everything into a Junk/Spam folder and letting it accumulate there... Cleaner internet=less lag and more fun
<p> I have been tracking emails this way through gmail for sometime. For the first time I have found one that doesn't have a "from" IP. How was he able to block this and is there anyway to report him still?
<p> It is driving me crazy but would you please assist me on how I can find a sender's ip address on Hotmail? I also have excite.com and it is so easy as all you do is click on this little icon but it is ridiculous on Hotmail Send a step by step method to find it. I really appreciate your assistance! Jay.
<p> I just wanted to thank you for your web site. Sometimes tracking a person is quite a challenge. Is there any software that would assist in this matter? If so, because I am not a tecky person, I could use the assistance.
<p> Recently due to some business problem, I had been trying to track the source location of the email which is received by me. Surprisingly it showed a particular place in USA. Before confirming I have checked one of my best friends mail location, and amusingly I found he is also send the mail from USA which is a 100% wrong information. Because, my friend is staying to next to my door, of course not in USA at all. So, come on guys tell me how can I locate the geographical origin location of the mail?
<p> i had someone hack into my e-mail and forward some e-mails to another e-mail adddress, they left the forwards in the sent file, is there a way to fine who did it by the forward, and who they went too, and a free site to track down the gmail account.
<p> My work email address was compromised and someone stole some information. They then sent me an email saying they have these items that are very important to me. I have tried to the reverse IP search and location but I never get the same info. I then did the tracert and with several of the addresses and they all came back with line one as D-link router but this is not possible. I really need help in tracing these emails and how to read the computer jargon....
<p> I tried this with my own email but the results don't turn up correctly. Geobytes is giving me the wrong info. How can I be sure I'm getting the right IP address? Because there are many included in the full message header of Yahoo mail....
<p> To my knowledge i think, following the above method shows the ip address of the provider only. For example, if a person sends an email from location x and we need to find the location of it using the ip, then the result we get from the above methods does not show the location x from where the mail is send, rather it shows the isp location of x.
<p> Is there any ways to find the exact/specific location of x rather than finding the isp location of x, if i am right ?
<p> I tried to find the IP address in MS Outlook. I'm operating in a LAN. But the procedure gave the the IP address of the mail server not the system from which the mail was originally sent. I want IP address of the system firing mail not of the server. Can somebody help please..
<p> i need further help... the email i'm trying to track has been forwared about 3 times. Here's the short story, my ex-husband hacked into my email address and sent out a very nasty email to someone. since he deleted everything, i didn't know about it until the email had been replied back to me. i have been trying to find out where my email originally was accessed from. but the ip address i have shows from where the second party replied from, not were my ex-husband accessed my account. Can you help????
<p> Honestly, the tips you have published are JUST GREAT! There is an asshole who keeps registering with my first and family name and also uses the name of my company. He keeps e-mailing me -- 30-40 mails per day, threatening me, offending me and this lasts for a month. I called the police and the mail provder he uses. no one did anything. Now, I decided to track him back myself, although I am into programming, etc. I tried tracking him but with other websites I either got to his mail provider location or to the one of his internet provider -- central office. With the website you suggest -- geobytes.com -- I succeeded in tracking him finally and am really happy!!! You made my days happy again. !!!! If I meet you, I owe you a GalaDinner at least !!!! Thank you !!
<p> I need help tracking the origin of an email. I was recently defrauded out of $8900 thinking I was purchasing equipment thru ebay and no agencies (no one) will help. Needless to say, this was a lot of money for me and my family and our Christmas is ruined. I can supply the Gmails but am not savvy enough to figure out how to track backwords. Any assistance is appreciated.
<p> I wonder if you can help me, my former boyfriend has used my secret answers to my hotmail account and used this account to send the following to my partner, the police are looking in to it but progress is very slow. Can you tell me which email address needs to be traced, the content would have orginated from my hotmail account and the different times show the activity, please can you help me?
<p> I read your knowledgeful article on how to track emails. I am pretty satisfied. I want to know what if i am given a different ip adress every time I start with my reliance net connection. Please also tell me what is sub-netting system where one ip adress is shared by more then one end users.
<p> I have been receiving harassing and threats of violence on Facebook via private messages. I keep blocking the person sending me the messages but he returns immediately with another fake account. I want find out how to trace IP addresses of people how message you on Facebook. I would pass on the IP address to the police to have this person prosecuted for harassment and stalking. I just need to know how to do it! I have tried a run cmd.exe command with the URL of the person who is messaging me but this did not work.
<p> This is not exactly related to tracking the location of an email via IP address, but I wanted to know if there was a way to track if an email was sent from a computer or from a mobile phone like the iPhone? Anything in the header that could help you figure it out?
<p> Hi Aseem, thanks for the info on tracking emails. I really loved it but if u would please help me locate this ip adress (10.216.85.202), I would be very appreciative. parcostudio@gmail.com and my email is kagome.arif@gmail.com . Thanks.

<p> I live in Jamaica, and I have been getting some ransomn emails from persons. They include my home address and telephone number and also the description of my car. How is it possible for me to get the exact location of the email sender...This help is needed urgently, even if it requires paying.
<p> I found these 2 awesome programs a few years back. Abuse & IPNetInfo. Both are free and have allowed me to track and report every spam email I received. Abuse scans the headers and comes up with the ISP then, sends in a pre-configured abuse email to them. I have had so many spammers/phishers/freaks, and so on I lost count. I hardly ever get spam any more. They must have put me on a "Don't Mess With" list...lol. Here's the site for Abuse.. . http://spam-abuse.sourceforge.net/ . IPNetInfo.. . http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/ipnetinfo.h\\... . For a filter I use Mailwasher Pro. The ONLY way to control these criminals and freaks is to FIGHT BACK. And these tools do that for you. I hope this helps all, who want to educate others and fight back.
<p> i have a school project and need your assistance before its the due date please help me out. Here is the project
<p> Take any email that has been sent to your mail account from outside Namibia and inspect its headers ( take a message
<p> with at least 6 "Received:" headers). List IP addresses and computer names from every mail server that has operated on this email. Describe in general terms how emails are transported from source to destination, and apply this description to the email you examined.
<p> okay, i did it, but i have gmail and it gave me 2 IP adresses next to each other. one was for florida, the other, australia. Some deuchebag stole my ipod and is taunting me by sending me messages using my ipod touch. i really want to kick her a**!!!! which IP address is correct... the first or second... (it looks like this)
<p> How do I go about tracing an email from hotmail.com. I don't see any of the drop down boxes you stated. I need to find the original IP address and then the address of that IP. Thanks for any help you can give me.
<p> I do find your blog very informative, but I have one query. How do I locate the person who is sending the email through GMAIL. I have seen that a lot of people have asked the same question but still no one has replied. I hope you may help.
<p> Please can someone help me trace this person. His name is John Hills and I need to know if he is legit or a scam because he's got all my account details and is now ignoring me. There is nothing on his e-mail exept his adress that is hillsloanfirm@gmail.com . He does not have a telephone number on nor a company name or anything.
<p> Hey, I have troubles with this. First of all congrats cause the post is so good that I fully understood it in the first try and I'm not even that smart.
<p> My trouble is the following, I need to track someone's IP to be able to prove where an e-mail was sent from. I didn't try it yet but I'd like to know if there is someway anyone can fool or change the IP adress using hack techniques or anything else making it either impossible to trace or fake another location, to be a 100% sure I'm not fooled. If so, how much of an expert must one be to be able to do something like that?
<p> I have not tested this yet, so it may not be as simple as it seems to be. Once you have the IP address and obtain the longitude and lattitude of that IP address, one can enter those numbers into any of several mapping programs and find the exact location quite precisely. This, of course, depends on accurate reporting of longitude and lattitude.
<p> Ok people.. you can trace people when they using gmail and hotmail and stuff.. View their source how its shown above. with hotmail u just right click the email u want in the inbox and view source(copy it). Then just search the web aka Google : trace email source . the internet is amazing /facepalm . then paste the source (alot of numbers, letters and symbols) and hit enter. depending the website, most tell you, they give you the lat and long the IP origin. If you not wat to look for you dont even have to use a website.
<p> Ok so I tryed tracking some emails received on my hotmail account.I used Mozilla Thunderbird as a client to make it easyer for identifying the IP.However, whatever i do or whichever IP I want to scan( i get multiple IP adresses), all of them show up as being from US, either New York or Cali.Any help ?
