<p> I told Siri to "Beam Me Up." She said, Wi-Fi or 3G? I asked her again and she said, "Please remove your belt, shoes and jacket, and empty your pockets." Asking her again she says, "Please install the lastest version of iCloud and try again." I asked her again and she replied, "Energizing." Next time I asked, she said, "Ok, please stand still." Any my favorite response, "Sorry Captain, your Tricorder is in airplane mode."
<p> "has us wondering if there is anything that the iPhone 4S' virtual assistant can't do"
<p> Really? Would you like a list? This reads like a gushing advertorial.
<p> Siri is just copying one of the features of Kinect, as launched back in 2010. It's a shame there were no articles like this ag the time, when it truly was new and innovative, but Apple-obsessed bloggers are less eager to report on Microsoft technology.
<p> It's funny that, since Siri was founded in 2007, 3 years before the Kinect, and has over 40 years of research.

<p> Eliza was one of the first and most famous of AI (natural language) programs written at MIT by Joseph Weizenbaum back in the 60?s. Nice touch :)

<p> one point, 40 people researching for 1 year. Is still 40 years of research. And then you can argue that by research it means between voice control and computer voices they have been researched and later in 2007 the research came out with an idea and they called it Siri.
