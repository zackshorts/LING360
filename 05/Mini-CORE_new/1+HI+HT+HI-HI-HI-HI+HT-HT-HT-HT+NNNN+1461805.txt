<h> Build a Minecraft Wizard Tower
<p> Thursday 02 Jun 2011 21:07
<p> Plotz online modeller for Minecraft now models Wizard Towers. By entering just a few values in boxes you can create your own custom wizard tower and then go on to build it in Minecraft using whatever materials you like. Plotz will model the walls, floors and roof. The rest is up to you.
<h> Model your Minecraft Wizard Tower
<p> Start by visiting Plotz modeller and click Take me to Plotz . In Plotz you can now build spheres, observatories and Wizard Towers. In the top left, click Change and select Wizard Tower. You will see the default wizard tower with a top floor diameter of 12 blocks and 3 floors just like below.

<h> Adjusting Tower Diameter
<p> Now you can experiment with changing the Wizard Tower. Change top floor diameter to increase the width of the top floor of the tower and all floors below. Large diameter floors mean a taller roof. Eventually Plotz will stop you altering this value when the tower reaches 64 blocks high. That's ground level to sky in Minecraft.
<h> Adjusting Tower Height and step
<p> Increase the number of floors to make the tower higher. Change this in conjunction with the step every value which controls after how many floors the tower steps out.
<p> Tall Wizard Tower with step every 1 floor
<p> Tall Wizard Tower with step every 3 floors
<h> Adding a side tower
<p> The checkbox next to side tower height will add a side tower. Side towers are about 2/3 the diameter of the main tower and placed on the middle floor (or as close as). The side tower is initially 1 floor high. Once checked, you can increase the side tower height to what you want.

<h> Building in Minecraft
<p> If you have a printer you can choose to print a schematic. I recommend turning off best fit before printing out a Wizard Tower schematic. Also you can step through the layers on screen as you build and I prefer this method myself. Start by entering a value of 1 in Show up to layer then use the up and down arrows next to that value to change it as you build.
<p> I think you should make Plotz model more buildings! Stuff like Ships, Mansions, Castles, Skyscrapers and stuff like that! It would be really cool and would really help some unexperienced builders such as myself build some awesome stuff! :D

<p> tip: you can fill your room with bookcases and make it a huge libary ;)

<p> I am making a wizard tower from glowstone, but I am struggling to pick an appropriate color for the roof tiles of the side tower and main tower. If you guys can please give me suggestions.
<p> And I am on creative mode

<p> I'm struggling to fill my tower and i was wondering if anyone had some good ideas for rooms.
<p> I'm working on my 10 story tower right now. I'll post a picture when I'm done. All in survival mode so getting the black wool has been a real chore.

<p> Very helpful tutorial. This tower looks very good in my SMP world.

<p> I heard that there was floor-by-floor schematics and I'm stuck on the side tower. Any help/suggestions?
<p> ZOMG i built one in my classic server (Uberswag Freebuild) its awsome, and simon sent me here lol... :3

<p> I blame Simon (Honeydew) for me coming here over a month after he posted the video, but I was having a real dickens of a time figuring out how to make it work, and this helped me. Thanks Kev, (And thanks Simon for showing me.) Also, Don't meddle in the affairs of dragons, for you are crunchy and good with ketchup.
<p> @jere - no plans to make a PNG output file. That would need to be server side but Plotz is client side running in your browser.
<p> @J926 tried your example. The 'schematic' expands or contracts as required so when you add the side tower it expands by enough to accomodate it.
<p> 1 Sep 2011 01:56 by jere
<p> can you make it so you can download a .png or something else that lets you see it instead of printing?

<p> How do you create a tower with a diameter of 13, similar to your pictures, and have the side tower not affect the Plotz? When I setup a 9 floor, 13 diameter, step every 3 floors, 8 floor high side tower everything is fine until I click the box to add the side tower. At that point the schematic is changed, and widened.
