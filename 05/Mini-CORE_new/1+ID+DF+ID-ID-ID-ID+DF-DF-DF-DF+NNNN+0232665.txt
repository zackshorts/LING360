<p> Synopsis:
<p> It is a comedy about the second coming and what would happen in this day and age.
<p> Mia is young, free and single and hasn't had sex for the last eleven and a half months, then one morning she wakes up pregnant, and on her door step is the Angel Gabriel claiming parentage. In Oliver Lansley's "Immaculate", things quickly spiral into farcical confusion with no fewer than three more potential fathers claiming parentage, one of them an ex-boyfriend, one of them a nerdish contemporary from school/who now thinks he is a stallion and the third being Satan himself.
