<p> Strange thing is, I'm sure this worked either with old versions of calibre or with old versions of samba. Is there anything I can tweak in Calibre, or anything I can tweak in samba to try to remedy this?

<p> Others may respond with advice that works, but I think that you probably can't correct this. Multiple users have reported their networked installs of calibre have recently run into trouble. The official line is to not run it on a network.
<p> My novice approach would be to export books locally then use an OS file manager or native sync software to get the books out to the share location.
<p> Good Luck.
