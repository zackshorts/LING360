<p> The Sunset is Burning! as a result of forest fires. And a Sandstone Face?
<p> These pictures were kind of tricky to shoot because of the smoke lingering in the valley from all of the forest fires; it was hard to focus and get a clear shot. The pics were taken this past Saturday and Sunday evenings near a mysterious Rock Face looking out over the valley. I have heard about The Face but did not know the exact location until this past week. The rock is kind of a rush, it really looks like a face from certain angles.

<p> I like my second pic because the sun almost looks like a UFO and The Face is looking at it. Table Rock is definately a mysterious place and the summer sunsets are amazing from up there.
