<p> We all know that Pepe is struggling at the moment as has not had a good two years between the sticks. I for one think its time for Jones to be given his chance to step up just like so many of the younger players have been given a chance.
<p> I did not start this thread to be slated. Sensible posts only please as this is just my opinion.
<p> No, did you see his clanger for the first goal. He strikes me as a dodgy keeper. I would have Pepe over Jones any day of the week. Though if Doni was available I would be happy to see him given a chance.

<p> You obviously haven't watched Doni at Roma before he came to Anfield. He was as shaky as Reina, not so good with his distribution and even worse as a shot stopper.
