<p> Many marketers feel that the first place you should post your article is to a article directory, like Ezine Articles or Go Articles...
<p> However, the very FIRST place you should post your article is your own website or blog first, before ever submitting any of them anywhere else at all.
<p> Let's use an example...Let's say that you have a website that focuses on "Dog Training"...You have the keywords "dog Training" properly placed throughout your website or blog...
<p> Let's say that a potential customer types the word "Dog Training" into a search engine...
<p> Which would you rather have happen: The customer finds your website FIRST or a Ezine article FIRST?
<p> You want the search engines to index your website or blog as a search result so that the potential customer finds your website FIRST...
<p> When you're trying to make money online you don't want your potential customers going off to an article directory! Let's say you have a 30% click-through rate from your article to your website.
<p> Then it's possible you're losing 70% of them.
<p> However, if they come straight to your site FIRST, you're not losing 70% of them. When you think about it, that can make all the difference in the world!
<p> So the key is this: always endeavor to publish your article on your website or blog FIRST before submitting it to a article directory.
<p> If you learn how to send potential customers to your website in the first place, rather than to an article directory, your "click through rate", that is, potential customers, will be much higher, and eventually so will your profits!..
