<h> Sharepoint List --&gt; File Error: Data May have been Lost

<p> Hi, I have a Windows Sharepoint Services 2007 list I export to Excel 2003 (SP3 11.8206.8202). Sharepoint creates an .iqy file and I open it in Excel. This creates a List range in the spreadsheet that is tied to the Sharepoint List (I make batch updates to the list, right-click and synch the list with the server, works fine). I save the workbook to my PC as .xls. When I open it later I get the error "File Error: Data May have been Lost", the list data is still there but the range is not i.e. the list range no longer has a blue border around it and I can no longer right-click and Synchronize List.
<p> It's like the link to the Sharepoint list was destroyed when I saved the file. I've been doing this process reliably for a while, It started consistently erroring as of Tuesday. Any ideas?
<p> Thanks, Matt

<p> I am also having the same issue. It seems to be related to the latest service pack. I have also seen that if I open an older version of one of my exel sheets with the SharePoint list it works until I save it and open it again. Any ideas on how this can be corrected would be appreciated.

<p> Hi,
<p> Perhaps the .xls file is damaged by some reason. You may try Advanced Excel Repair at http://www.datanumen.com/aer/ This tool is rather useful in salvaging damaged Excel xls files. Hope this will help.

<p> Same problem here.
<p> I managed to get the error to disappear if i removed some Calculated Columns from the export - the ones with longish formulas.
