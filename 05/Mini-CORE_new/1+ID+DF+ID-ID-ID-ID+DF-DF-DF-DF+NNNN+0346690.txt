<h> Author Topic: Were you 'one of the forty'?  (Read 4431 times)
<p> During the spring, forty brave Rawkites became hostages to fortune with the click of a mouse.
<p> Not for us the return of a Messiah, not for us a ?proven? manager, nor were we persuaded by another comparative ing‚nue from a few miles up the M58
<p> No, we chose the Liverpool manager as our Liverpool manager.
<p> As that first press conference drew to a close I?m certain that I was just one of at least forty believers intoxicated by the substance, composure and delivery that we had witnessed. A few doubters began to join us, a few nevers turned to maybes
<p> This man was starting to convince.
<p> Five months and the odd roughly hewn milestone or two later, how does that click feel today?
<p> A bit of background to set the scene. For the first time in my 30+ years supporting the club, I am older than the manager. For the first time since the Souness era (I don?t count Hodgson) my dad is openly criticising the manager in his first season. Where once I got that knot of excitement in the stomach, going to the game is almost starting to feel like an experience to be endured.
<p> Almost
<p> Because for every 0-0 at home to Stoke there is a 2-5 at Carrow Road, for every 3-0 at West Brom there is a..........1-2 at West Brom!
<p> But ultimately because it still just feels right. For all the stats and the philosophy and the debates about possession versus penetration, my gut still tells me that this man is right for the club, for the players and for the supporters.
<p> And if you can?t let your gut rule your head in football then where can you?
<p> So for me, if I had the choice again today, I would click that button faster than the missus clicking speed dial during a QVC Northern Nights clearance sale.
<p> Now it?s over to you, fellow Brendan Rodgers kingmakers: would you make the same choice today?
<p> (Humbly request that if you are not one of the chosen few, please refrain from comment, I hope you?ll all agree it would be much more interesting to limit the responses to the remaining thirty nine worms lurking in the wood.)

<p> Havent seen enough in the mans career and LFC career so far to suggest good things re on the horizion.  I hope i am wrong i really do but i dont buy into the BR lark, yes he comes across ok in teh media, yes he talks a good game but where is teh substance. I always had the inescaplle feeling that when Rafa was sacked we were heading for mid table medicrity.
<p> I listen to people tlak on here and i just dont see it, its not that i dont want to see it i just dont buy it. Like i sadi i hope im worng and BR does a good job and brings us sucess  A sucessful LFC vs me being wrong then i would be wrong all day every fucking day.
<p> No doubt i will get shotdown for this - but before you do, this is not hatred of teh manager i just dont believe he is good enough, never will be
<p> I believe in Rodgers and his methods, perhaps even moreso than when he arrived.
<p> It can be frustrating that philosophy sometimes wins out over pragmatism, but the philosophy will stand us in good stead. For instance, letting the likes of Kuyt, Bellamy and Maxi go when we were already short on goals was always going to leave us in short-term trouble, but by playing the likes of Sterling, Borini and Suso in their place we are putting ourselves in a much better position 2/3 years down the track.
<p> In terms of our playing style, we have seen our defense and midfield struggle at times with the pass-it-out approach, but you also sense that once they get comfortable with the system the rewards will be much greater. Would we have more points if we'd kept Carroll, lumped it up at him and had Kuyt and Maxi swarming around for the scraps? Most likely we would, but the ceiling with Andy and a group of above-average, not-outstanding 30+ year-olds would have been much lower.
<p> I'm happy we have a manager who doesn't bring in journeyman veterans or "free" transfers on abominable wages, and gives real young talent a chance to thrive in a system with real potential. Could not give a rat's arse about media perception, it's just the feel I get about our long-term prospects. We need patience, not just because sacking managers every year will take you nowhere, but because Rodgers is the first manager since Rafa to have had a clear and credible long-term plan.
<p> I voted for Rodgers. I didn't want Kenny to be sacked, but reasoned that Rodgers was the best option, and I still believe that now. I liked Laudrup but wasn't convinced he was the kind of architect we needed at all levels of the club (he doesn't tend to stay too long wherever he goes). Rodgers is gonna do well.

<p> First of all I'm sick and tired of all this "he talks a good game" bolix.One of the requirements of the job is to conduct yourself in the correct manner in relation to the position he's holding.He's doing that,so lets stop slating him for it.
<p> We all went mad the way Hodgson came across in the media and rightly so.
<p> He's a young manager yes.Relatively inexperienced when he came into the job.He's trying to put together a plan here.His own way of playing.I think that's quite brave of him and should be commended.Is it going to happen overnight? Certainly not.He has a thin squad.He's had to dip into the reserve squad of last season and make them first team regulars.Gems these young lads may be but its a long drawn out season and it would be a big ask for these lads to keep that level of performance up for 38 games.
<p> He needs to be given time and support.Chopping and changing managers does nobody any good.We've done that too much recently.We might have got rid of H&G but they've left a stain on this club that will take some time to clean off.The domino effect from Rafa's sacking needs to be stopped.It will be a long had road back.A lot of hard work to be done here.Gladly Rafa's legacy will be the revamping of the youth set up and now we are seeing the fruits of that.
<p> I believe Brendan can be the one to take us forward.Rome wasn't built in a day though.

<p> What's your point though mate ? Rafa's not here,I wanted him back,I never wanted him gone day one.
<p> Rogers is here now and he should get our support while he is.

<p> I am almost certain that I would have voted Rafa. I just love that man. I'm also almost certain we would have had Ian Ayre (and maybe FSG) hung, drawn and quartered publically if that transfer window fiasco occured under his watch. While I agree Ayres needs removing from the process and someone with more experience in football in a day to day decision making position, I think in hindsight that Rafa would have been a bad move. He would have been frustrated with FSG & Ayres and I think we need a period of healing and start dealing with problems in the board room instead of on the broad sheets.
<p> I also think the lack of patience from our supports is astonishing. They have huge expectations and want them to be instantly satisfied. Why can't he win us the European Cup while rebuilding, Rafa did? It's because he isn't pragmatic like Rafa.
<p> I think all those who pushed for Rafa to be sacked are also the ones using Rafa as a stick to beat Rodgers with. I think all those who predicted a long period of suffering if we kicked Rafa (like me) are still pining for him and hurt that he wasnt even talked to in the summer. I also think those who were hurt by Kennys sacking are scratching their heads thinking "how are these results any better than what Kenny gave us?".
<p> A lot of people need to just forget everything that has gone before and accept this is where we are. We are a mid table side. We have been since Rafa's final year. We are still recovering from H&G, Hodgson, Purslow, Comolli and the combined damage they have done at the club. I am seeing things now to start feeling positive about. I was always happy to write this season off and that hasn't changed. As long as I see significant progess and a clear path being laid to successful football. At the moment I am seeing glimpses to that. I want to see more but I am also willing to wait until Rodgers has more than one striker to even begin thinking about judging him.
<p> I think I may have voted for Van Gaal on the basis that if we were going to behave like a bunch of chimps trying to fuck a beachball, we might as well get a proper nutter in to be master of ceremonies.
<p> What's with this 'one of the 40' stuff anyways? Miles better title than the one the other night, but still not sure whether you're trying to recreate 7 Up or give out cards with membership numbers on them.

<p> "And the voices of the standing Kop still whispering in the wind will salute the wee Scots redman and he will still walk on. And your money will have bought you nothing."
<p> still backing him, cause that's what we do. he gets us. he needs time. we give him time, owners give him resources and we wont be far away. TIME, HE NEEDS TIME & PATIENCE. I blame Chelsea, big brother, man city and the english media & press for the endless need for instant success and "voting off" who you don't like. world class manager, nah, hes shite, paper said so, sack him.
<p> If my assistant had not signalled a goal, I would have given a penalty and sent off goalkeeper Patr Cheh. he beeped me to signal the foul. The noise from the crowd  stopped me hearing it, I have been involved at places like Barcelona, Ibrox, Old Trafford, Arsenal, but I've never in my life been involved in such an atmosphere. IT WAS INCREDIBLE
<p> Strachan hit the nail on the head. Without good players at the top this system is doomed to failure. Wait until Louis has a bit of help, Lucas returns and gets fit and see where we are then. I think we should have given Kenny time, now, I think we have an impressive Manager who lacks experience. Given time and that experience he will in my opinion be a success.
<p> Firstly, I do get why this thread was started. It was a mad time on here during those two weeks without a manager, every RAWKite with their own favorite, campaigning for their chosen leader as if it was a presidential election. So it's interesting to look back now and to ask why those few who took an early punt on Rodgers did so at the time, and what they think now.
<p> But, I also think that limiting it to the 40 also limits the usefulness of the thread. I thought at the time that the poll was misleading, and it's probably even more misleading in retrospect. I voted for Rafa out of sentimental reasons, as a show of support for a man who did so much for our club. At the time my real response was a much more cautious 'wait and see', but the temptation to give Rafa a vote of confidence was too much. Having said that, my vote for Rafa in no way meant that I was dissapointed when Rodgers was given the job, in fact I was very optimistic. Still am very optimistic.
<p> Another problem with the poll was that a lot of votes went to unrealistic options, it was clear from day 1 that the likes of Klopp and Guardiola were unavailable, but they racked up a lot of votes. It's also worth mentioning that Rodgers ruled himself out of the race early on as he didn't want to be part of the shortlist circus, so this might have stopped some people from voting for him or even considering him. If a more realistic poll had been taken without the sentimental pull of Rafa or the big name but unavailable managers then I suspect a lot more people would be able to contribute to this thread. I don't know if I would have been one of those people, but I do know that as soon as Rodgers name was announced I stopped 'campaigning' and started supporting.
<p> I think I may have voted for Van Gaal on the basis that if we were going to behave like a bunch of chimps trying to fuck a beachball, we might as well get a proper nutter in to be master of ceremonies.
<p> That's tremendous!
<p> I didn't want Kenny to go, though he deserved another year with Clarke. I voted Rafa. I thought BR was too inexperienced for the job in hand. I thought there needed to be a strong DoF if we were having a young manager. I still think that.
<p> I voted Rafa. I didn't think Rodgers had enough top flight experience to manage a club like ours. I never wanted Rafa to go, I didn't feel it was time for him to go when the cancers sacked him and i felt and still do feel that he has unfinished business at the club but now would have to do a rebuilding job again. Would he get given the financial backing?
<p> I never wanted Kenny to go. I thought he and Clarke got the team playing well and organised and didn't think it was time to let Kenny go and that he was just at the start of something.
<p> I like Rodgers and when it was between him and Martinez I preferred Rodgers as my choice and I admire what he is trying to do here. I just wish he could be a little more pragmatic in his approach to bringing it about. Rather than his plan A and if that doesn't work then tough because it should.
<p> Our squad in my opinion needs a good œ200m investing into it but it won't happen all at once as our new owners are like Arsenals. All about the FFP rules (which i think they are being abit naive about as UEFA wouldn't have the balls to implement them properly and tell the likes of United, City, Chelsea, Barca and Madrid that they can't play in the CL until there debt free - Plus all those clubs will find loop holes in the FFP regulations ala City naming there stadium through their owners company to get round them anyway). I don't think Rodgers will be able to buy the players he wants at the same time and he'll be given œ20m plus what he generates in sales every summer and will need to build the team up over years. The million dollar question is will he be given the time and patience to do it?
<p> Sadly I was one of the other 40 or is that 4,000,000? I know he's been hung out to dry by FSG, but his signings so far are like beginning to look like square pegs mashed into round holes. His decisions bad ones. Borini played out of position,not looking up to the life in the Premiership, playing on with an injury against the Mancs which has resulted in losing him for a large chunk of season when a striker was needed. Allen also  being played out of position.His insistance  on playing Allen in every game despite the fact he is looking more and more tired with every game. Sahin not looking up to Premiership standard. Of the players he inherited, Gerrard can still do a job on the right of the three  or supporting Suarez. He doesn't seem to want to try it. Shelvey and Henderson looked good together in the middle under Kenny, never seen in BRs formations. Why is Joe Cole still at the club? Andy Carroll treated disgracefully l (Sent out on loan when needed and told in no uncertain manner he's not needed unlike Cole) Squad rotation works in the league, ask whisky nose His new philosophy is  not new to LFC we always played like this until Houllier came along. The Emperor has new clothes and you don't need to go to Specsavers to know what's going on
<p> I don't think you can form an absolute appointment in 10-20 games. He needs a season and a more.
<p> Some of the things worry me greatly. I think he worries more about possession than he does about the actually scoring goals. The chances created and clear cut chances have reduced dramatically from last season. I think Kenny's system needed a few tweaks but he went with an overhaul.
