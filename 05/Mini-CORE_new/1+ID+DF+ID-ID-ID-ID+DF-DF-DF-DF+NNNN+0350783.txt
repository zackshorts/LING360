<h> Self employed lone parent
<p> Hi everyone, here's my situation: I'm a lone parent with 2 small kids and I've been offered a job in Central London as mother's help/nanny. Since I have a Bachelor's Degree in Preschool Teaching and I have experience in childcare, how much do you thing I should charge per hour?
<p> The thing is that I will be self employed and I don't really know how much your salary is reduced, so I was wondering what rate should I tell my employer? By the way, she agreed to pay my travelling expenses as well, which will be 25,50 pounds per week (I will be working 16 hours per week and I will pay aproximately 250 pounds per week in childcare for my kids).
<p> Nannies / mothers help are not self employed. You will be doing a part time job just like anyone else. Your employer will I expect, tell you when to arrive, when to leave, what to do. What makes you think it's something that you can do as a business?
<p> Nannies get paid various salaries depending on location and experience. You may be looking at somewhere from œ7 to œ13 per hour calculated out to an annual salary.
<p> You will be paying œ200 a week for childcare for your own children. That means that your job will need to pay more than that. Assuming no other income (such as income support or other benefits), then to get a take home pay of œ200 a week, I make it that you have to be earning œ13.92 gross an hour, if you work 16 hours a week. PAYE Calculator which will do Net to Gross
<p> Working in childcare is not going to pay you enough in my view for you to afford childcare for your own two children. It may be more financially viable once both children are in full time school, so you are able to work a significant number of hours during which you are not paying for childcare.
<p> Perhaps you can get some funding towards the cost of your own childcare, such as childcare element of working tax credit. However that funding may be available now but it might not in future and will be affected by how much you earn. Are you being forced to find a job?
<p> Thanx everyone for your advice but i've decided not to take this job because it turns out that i will be paying œ300(!) per week for childcare and only getting œ160. Yes, i'm entittled to working tax credit because i'm a lone parent, but still that wouldn't be enough... My children are 3y and 20m but the nursery hours won't much (for the 3y old) because it was an afternoon job 15:00-20:00.
<p> Anyway, other than that, we had a disagreement about my employment status which she was insisting that i would be self employed but in the HMRC website says that this is not a matter of choice, so according to my circumstances i was going to be employed.
