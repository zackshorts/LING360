<p> Yep for sure.....all you can do it twiddle your thumbs and wait. If you think about it, all our futures are totally in their hands and we cant do anything about it but wait. Just one day, I would like them to sit in our shoes and feel the pain we go thru every day, waiting and not knowing and not being able to be with our loved ones.......maybe then they wouldn't have so many coffee breaks and work quicker on our apps. LOL
<p> I sit around and think about what more I should/could have written on my application. It can drive a person CrAzY!!!!! I started a project of getting additional proof together i.e. phone top ups, letters of support, pictures, resort stays, flight itinerary's, etc, etc, etc. since I submitted the original application in March so we're ready should Kingston want additional documentation of our genuine relationship!!!!!

<p> im doing the samething here aswel......i have a big envelope here with all my documents and pic of when my wife was here with all my western union papers i got.....i even have a list of potential interview questions they would ask me at the interview with all my answers next to the questions......so im really getting prepared for anything they have to offer.
<p> I am new to this forum....I am getting married in March (have to wait until my divorce is final) and then starting the process to get my husband here.  Any words of advice?  I know that the website says average processing times out of Kingston are 16 months or something like that however, I see that many of the people on this forum have their spouse here quite a bit faster....obviously I want to get him here as quickly as possible, so any tips would be appreciated!
<p> Thanks
<p> Congrats and welcome! advice would be to gather as much evidenceas possible like pics , phone logs, letters, emails, travel docs etc. and make sure that everything is completed. There is a forum here that has some good tips on how to prepare your papers. It may be of great help to you.

<p> There was a great thread on the forum about questions that could be asked at the interview. I'll search for it this weekend and if I find it I'll let you know where it is so you can be extra prepared if you have to go for an interview. Hopefully it will be waived!

<p> i have the list of question already in my position but if you can find it please post it for other ppl to look at....it may be helpful to other members.
<p> The only advice I can give right now is to start working on the application now because there is alot of paperwork to be done LOL
<p> Good luck and if you get stuck on anything in the app, come back here and someone will surely help you out.
<p> Morning everyone, long time i havnt been on the forum, trying to get myself and family setteled in winnipe.  Would like to link up with some jcans in winnipeg, anyone can link me .  Chicky how things so far with your processing with kingston
<p> Good morning forum family I trust everyone is well and a big welcome to our newbies, do stick and stay. I see some questions and concerns re: e-cas and updates, it has been my experience that it is seldom updated, once KG has your file it will say in process until you get the PPR call. For many of us it didn't change to decision made until after the landing so don't stress over not hearing anything because very few do. As for interview question it is good to be prepared. Below is a list of generic questions that may be asked. From what I've read most questions will be about how well do you know your spouse, we all put down that we talk everyday so if you are husband and wife you should be talking as such. Also if you have any red flags be prepared to explain it thoroughly. Anyway good luck to everyone, and KG your $hit together KG and help Santa out here eh!

<p> Good afternoon to all..........Chickie72 i do agree with you about not seeing any movements until next year..i just hope if it is next year they get to us at least make it in the beginning of the year and not the end.....Kingston really need to get there thing together for sure.....i been viewing other threads on this site and most of the ppl are getting through very quick although i know every case is different but when we are waiting for our spouse to be reunited with each other it all the same in my book

<p> yes that is true, you sit there and wonder why can't we get thru as fast as everyone else and truly some of those must have more or around the same amount of applications going thru their VO's. Kingston to other VO's is like snail mail to email LOL
<p> yes chickie72 it look like kingston is still in the stone ages when it come to these things.....i know that they have alot of immigration officers working in the embassy but the rate they are going make it look like there is only one person that deal with all the applications........like what ppl always say "My grandmother can move faster than that" Come on Kingston It about time to let all of us know somethings about there applications
