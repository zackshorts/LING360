<p> Had a bit of a panic attack this morning when I though about Liverpool FC without Stevie G. What are we going to do? He is a point of reference for this club, and I cannot see any other player who will take that mantle when he goes. Almost like losing the very heart and soul of our team. It is going to be a very different club when he leaves and I am not so sure it will be for the better.

<p> Tbh, the club needs to do something sharpish, listening to people talk about this club of late, tells me just how low down the pecking order we are just now.
<p> It's wrong, because lots of clubs have jumped ahead by way of welathy owners, but ahead they are, and there they will stay untill we do something very special, or something very special happens to this club.
<p> Its like he's a different player when he's got the England Captain head on. I don't listen to him or pay any attention to him at all. Couldn't give a fuck about all the Ingerlund interview banalities and his thoughts on the shit he has around him for them.
<p> Looking at that squad though, its got to be the worst England squad ever put together?
<p> Really worried that he's going into this stupid friendly not 100% fit. Another reason why hodgson is an arsehole
<p> i think reaching the 100 cap mark is a big deal for steve. will he continue to be arsed to turn out for england now he has reached this milestone...

<p> Id play him as a CF & get in a decent attacking mid & a forward in the tranny window...

<p> Stevie and Carra are long term servants to this club, living legends if you will (just like Kenny and Keegan etc) but the life goes on
