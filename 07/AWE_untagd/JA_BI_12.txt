Remarks
If Sama (2002) was correct, this species must be extremely rare. This species is
polyphagous in deciduous trees (especially Quercus, also in Carpinus, Aesculus, Fagus,
Castanea, Ulmus, Malus, Betula). Larvae feed subcortically in dead branches and
stems (Svacha and Danilevsky 1987; Bense 1995; Sama 2002). All records, including
the present record, from Turkey show the species probably is distributed across the
whole of northern Turkey.
Phymatodes Mulsant, 1839
The genus is represented in Turkey by four species belonging to three subgenera: the
nominotypical subgenus, Melasmetus Reitter, 1913 and Phymatodellus Reitter, 1913.
P. (Melasmetus) femoralis (Menetries, 1832) has been recorded in Turkey only from
Istanbul province in the north-west, as P. femoralis demelti Heyrovski, 1961. So the
species is represented only by this subspecies in Turkey now. The nominotypical subspecies,
which was described from Caucasus, is distributed only in Caucasus and Iran.
P. (s. str.) testaceus (Linnaeus, 1758) has been reported by various authors from different
localities in Turkey as cited in Özdikmen 2007, 2008. It is distributed rather widely
in Turkey. P. (Phymatodellus) magnanii Sama and Rapuzzi, 1999 is known only from
the type localities of Antalya and ?Içel provinces. So it is distributed only in southern
and south-western Turkey. P. (Phymatodellus) rufipes (Fabricius, 1777) has been
reported in Turkey by a few authors, from various localities in both the north and
south. It is represented by two subspecies in Turkey: P. rufipes rufipes in northern
Turkey and P. rufipes syriacum (Pic, 1891) in southern Turkey.
Zoogeographically, P. (M.) femoralis has SW-Asiatic (Anatolo-Caucasian +Irano-
Caucasian + Irano-Anatolian), P. (s. str.) testaceus has Holaractic, P. (Phymatodellus)
magnanii has Anatolian and P. (Phymatodellus) rufipes has European chorotype. Poecilium Fairmaire, 1864
This genus is represented in Turkey by four species: P. alni (Linnaeus, 1767), P.
fasciatum (Villers, 1789), P. lividum (Rossi, 1794) and P. pusillum (Fabricius, 1787).
P. alni has been reported by various authors from different localities in Turkey as
cited in Özdikmen 2007. It is probably distributed rather widely in Turkey, and is
represented there by two subspecies. The nominotypical subspecies is known from
Spain to European Russia and Kazakhstan (including European Turkey). P. alni
pici (Aurivillius, 1912) occurs only in south European Russia, Caucasus (Georgia,
Armenia and Azerbaijan) and northern Anatolian Turkey. P. alni pici was not mentioned
by Sama and Löbl (2010) for Turkey. P. fasciatum (Villers, 1789) has not been
recorded from Turkey from any exact locality, although Sama (2002) and Sama and
Löbl (2010) mentioned that the species occurs in southern Turkey. P. lividum (Rossi,
1794) has been reported by a few authors from ?Istanbul, Sakarya and ?Içel provinces
as cited in Özdikmen 2008, so it is probably distributed rather widely in the western
half of Turkey. P. pusillum (Fabricius, 1787) has been reported by a few authors from
?Istanbul and Konya provinces, so it is probably also distributed rather widely in the
western half of Turkey. It is represented by the nominotypical subspecies in European
Turkey and P. pusillum rufipenne (Starck, 1889) in Anatolian Turkey. However, Sama
and Löbl (2010) did not mention the species for Turkey.
Zoogeographically, P. alni has W-Palaearctic, P. fasciatum has S-European,
P. lividum has Mediterranean and P. pusillum has European chorotype. Lioderina Ganglbauer, 1886
This monotypic genus is also represented in Turkey. L. linearis (Hampe, 1871) has
until now been reported with an exact locality in Turkey only by Adlbauer (1988)
from Ni?gde province. So it is probably distributed in the western half of Turkey.
Zoogeographically, L. linearis has SE-European chorotype.
