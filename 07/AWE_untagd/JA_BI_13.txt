Introduction
Coral reefs constitute a unique marine ecosystem harboring diverse and abundant prokaryotic communities [1–6]. A number of studies have shown that a dynamic microbial biota lives on the surface and in the tissue of many coral species [3–5] but as of yet, the exact functions of such populations and their contributions to corals have not been fully elucidated. Rohwer et al. [4] consider corals to be a holobiont comprising the cnidarian host, its accompanying zooxanthellae, and microbial communities. They further hypothesize that changes in physiological parameters in one or more of the partners can cause dissociation of the partnerships, resulting in pathogen driven disease (e.g., black band disease, bleaching, white pox) or in general physiological changes that do not always manifest themselves morphologically. It has been suggested that microorganisms inhabiting the coral tissues and mucus may protect the holobiont from pathogens [4]. Another potential role suggested for these microorganisms may be to supply the coral with nitrogen and phosphorous, elements not provided by their symbiotic zooxanthellae [6,7–11]. It has recently been demonstrated that mucus-associated bacteria assist in coral nutrition [6,12] and that these microorganisms respond to coral stress [1].
The recently proposed “Coral Probiotic Hypothesis” [13] asserts that changes in environmental conditions result in changes in the diverse, metabolically active microbial population found in and on the coral hosts. This shift may aid the coral holobiont in adapting to the new conditions [13]. This hypothesis is supported by observations that corals harbor a wide and diverse bacterial population and that these coral-associated bacteria undergo a rapid change in population in response to alterations in environmental conditions [13]. These changes in associated microbial communities may allow corals to overcome disease and perhaps develop resistance to certain microbial-driven diseases [13]. Indeed, coral mucus-associated bacteria have been shown to possess antibacterial activity.
Ritchie [14] demonstrated that mucus from the coral Acropora palmata harbors bacteria displaying antibacterial activity and suggested that coral mucus bacteria contribute to the protection of the coral holobiont. Her findings showed that 20 % of cultivable bacteria isolated from A. palmata exhibit antibiotic activity against one or more tester strains. In a previous study, our group [15] demonstrated that approximately 25 % of cultivable mucus bacteria isolated from different stony coral species display antibiotic activity, secreting active compounds into the growth medium. Vizcaino et al. [16] isolated 108 distinct bacteria from the Caribbean octocoral Pseudopterogorgia americana, of which 12 (11 %) inhibited the coral pathogen Vibrio coralliilyticus-type strain at 24 °C and 5 (4.6 %) at 27 °C. They suggested that V. coralliilyticus possess antimicrobial resistance, which may be temperature-dependent, against a large portion of coral-associated bacteria [16]. Nissimov et al. [17] demonstrated that 9 out of 156 (5.8 %) mucus isolates from the Mediterranean coral Oculina patagonica inhibited growth of the coral pathogen Vibrio shiloi and other marine and terrestrial bacteria, some of which are pathogenic. There is little information regarding Gram-positive coral pathogens. However, there are a few reports regarding disease-associated Gram-positive bacteria isolated from infected corals. Frias-Lopez et al. [18] reported sequences associated with Clostridium (Gram-positive bacteria) occurring in black band disease mat clone libraries obtained from Montastrea annularis and Diploria strigosa. Cooney et al. [19] also found Clostridium sequences obtained from BBD-infected- and non-diseased-corals using culture-independent techniques. These putative coral pathogens were detected in clone libraries of diseased corals, but their role in coral disease is not fully understood.
