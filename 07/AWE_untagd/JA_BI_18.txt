Aquatic Hyphomycete Community Through the Leaf Litter Decomposition
We observed some clear patterns in the aquatic hyphomycete communities associated with leaf litter during decomposition. The increases in taxa richness along the process confirm assertions such as more than a week of incubation being necessary prior to the detection of the first conidia from species other than some pioneer taxa [11, 21, 49]. As our study showed, taxonomic richness and sporulation rates were low after a week of incubation, increasing thereafter. Sporulation rate dynamics along the process were similar for the three streams studied, with a peak 2–4 weeks after implantation. Maximum conidial production varies depending on the substrata and the systems, appearing usually between 10 days and a month of incubation [11, 21, 26, 42]. Suberkropp [52] pointed out the coincidence of a sporulation peak (at 2–3 weeks) with periods of increasing fungal biomass (as ATP) and activity (as respiration). However, Pozo et al. [46] found a relative delay between mycelial biomass (measured as ergosterol) and sporulation rates. The reduction in conidial adhesion capability to pre-colonized material [39] might help explain the reduction of conidial production observed in later phases of decomposition. On the other hand, although conidial release might start soon after initial colonization, it tends to decrease dramatically when mycelial growth is limited [52]. Our results have implications in the experimental design for future studies; while sporulation rate tends to peak after 2–4 weeks incubation, maximum taxonomic richness tends to occur later, in the middle of the process, which means that samples at T 50 might give a good estimate of numbers of species, but does not register sporulation peaks, several sampling dates being required during leaf processing in order to detect them.
In our study, F. curvula and T. elegans defined sporulation dynamics throughout the process at sites where they were dominant. Although F. curvula and L. curvula, both with small, unbranched conidia, are typically pioneer species [56], they were also abundant later, as observed earlier in our study area [11]. On the other hand, in spite of the large conidial size of T. elegans (1.42 ng), far above that of F. curvula and L. curvula [10], the former was responsible for the early sporulation peak at one of the sites. The branched conidia in T. elegans (typically tetraradiate with long arms) could be an example of an efficient evolutionary adaptation to adherence to the preferred substrate, i.e., deciduous leaves [6]. Treton et al. [56] found that T. elegans could dominate conidial production even in the presence of taxa with a higher sporulation potential, such as F. curvula and L. curvula, both with simple (sigmoid) shapes. Dang et al. [16] found that T. elegans presented twice the attachment frequency of F. curvula on alder leaves after the initial 24 h. But other taxa with complex (tetraradiate) conidia, such as T. chaetocladium and A. acuminata, did show late sporulation peaks in relation to the dominant simple shapes of e.g., F. curvula. Sporulation by T. chaetocladium, with large conidia (1.83 ng) and low productivity [10], peaked relatively late (after 2–3 months), as previously detected in studies carried out in the same geographical area [11]. It would be useful to have a deeper understanding of the relationships between conidial production and mycelial biomass, in terms of metabolic cost.
