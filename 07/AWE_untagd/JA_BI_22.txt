Immunohistochemistry, microscopy, and image processing
Adult brains and eyes, as well as pupal brains and eye–brain complexes, were dissected as previously reported (Williamson and Hiesinger, 2010b). In brief, the tissues were fixed in PBS with 3.7% formaldehyde for 30 min and washed in PBS with 0.4% Triton X-100. High-resolution light microscopy was performed at room temperature using a resonance-scanning confocal microscope (SP5; Leica) using a 63× HCX Plan Apochromat, NA 1.45, glycerin lens. Imaging data were processed and quantified using Amira 5.2 (Indeed), Photoshop (CS2; Adobe), and ImageJ (National Institutes of Health). All confocal data were obtained as 3D dataset, and all images shown are either single sections or maximum intensity projections of small subsets that were equally processed for controls and mutants. Blind deconvolution was applied as previously published (Hiesinger et al., 2001). For the quantification of up/down-regulation in mutant versus wild-type photoreceptor terminals, 50% mutant photoreceptor mosaics were created and verified using anti–n-Syb immunolabeling or other established markers. 3D confocal stacks of three to five specimens were quantified for the ratio of total fluorescence in 3 µm3 of mutant terminals divided by total fluorescence in 3 µm3 of wild-type terminals for each of the 16 markers individually. For the wild-type colocalization experiments, anti–n-Syb immunolabeling was analyzed for at least three specimens per colocalization experiment. For each colabeling experiment, clear and distinct n-Syb–positive punctae were selected blindly with no other channel visible. Each n-Syb–positive puncta was subsequently manually analyzed for colocalization with each of the 16 markers individually. The following antibodies were used: Syx7/Avalanche (at 1:1,000), Hrs (at 1:300), Rab5 (at 1:1,000), Rab7 (at 1:1,000), Hook (at 1:1,000), Syt (at 1:1,000), CSP (at 1:50), Chaoptin (at 1:50), V100 (at 1:2,000), and n-Syb (at 1:1,000). All confocal microscopy samples were mounted in mounting medium (Vectashield; Vector Laboratories) for fluorescence microscopy. Secondary antibodies used were Cy3, Cy5 (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.), and Alexa Fluor 488 (Invitrogen) raised against guinea pig, mouse, rabbit, or rat.
ERGs
ERGs were recorded as previously described (Fabian-Fine et al., 2003; Williamson et al., 2010a). In brief, flies were reversibly glued on slides using nontoxic school glue. Light stimulus was provided in 1-s pulses by a computer-controlled white light-emitting diode system (MC1500; Schott). Data were recorded using Clampex (version 10.1; Axon Instruments) and measured using Clampfit (version 10.2; Axon Instruments).
Western blots of mutant eye–lamina complexes, coimmunoprecipitations, and pull-downs
Eyes were dissected from 1-d-old flies in HL3 medium (Stewart et al., 1994). Groups of 20 eyes were collected in HL3 and then crushed in 10 µl extraction buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM PMSF, and protease inhibitor [Complete; Roche]). Samples were incubated on ice for 15 min and then centrifuged at 16,000 RCF for 10 min at 4°C to precipitate debris. Next, 9 µl of sample was then added to 9 µl of 2× Laemmli buffer to make a final concentration of 1 eye/µl. 10 eyes were run on each lane of a 12.5% PAGE gel.
Coimmunoprecipitations. 
Flies were frozen in liquid nitrogen, and heads were collected with a sieve. Total protein was extracted in immunoprecipitation buffer containing 20 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM PMSF, and Complete protease inhibitors, pH 7.4. The fly head extract was mixed well in 1% Triton X-100 (Bio-Rad Laboratories) and incubated for 1 h at 4°C. Samples were centrifuged at 16,000 g for 15 min at 4°C to remove cell debris.
