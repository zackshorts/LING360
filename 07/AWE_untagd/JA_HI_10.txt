In the American context, the modernist aesthetic approach to traditional African
sculpture was closely tied to race politics, even as it recapitulated the ambivalences
of the French discourse of connoisseurship: in New York, as in Paris, these objects
generally were seen not as contemporary creations, but as antiquities—“ancestral”
sources of an alternative classical tradition. The African American philosopher Alain
Locke, for example, in his influential 1925 anthology The New Negro, pointed with
pride to the “growing influence of African art upon European art in general.” For
him, traditional African sculptures were “arts of the forefathers,” which had the
potential to give contemporary black artists “the lesson of a classic background, the
lesson of discipline, of style, of technical control pushed to the limits of technical
mastery.”74 At the same time, a growing number of white collectors saw an interest
in African sculpture as a natural complement to progressive racial attitudes. Barnes,
for instance, served as a bridge between Guillaume and African American intellectuals;
several photographs of works from his collection appeared in Locke’s anthology.
The numerous addresses of American primitive art collectors that Parisian
dealer Louis Carre´ gathered during his trip to New York for the 1935 MoMA show
provide further proof of the large moneyed public that was willing to embrace traditional
African sculpture in the United States at the time.75

Nevertheless, throughout this period, there was a difference in degree between
American and French knowledge of these objects. Interwar Paris was in the throes
of “negrophilia,” a widespread fascination with things black, ranging from jazz to
traditional African sculpture.76 Jean-Louis Paudrat suggests that there were 147 private
collections of African sculpture in the city by 1930, and in 1931, African objects
fetched record prices in a pair of highly publicized auctions.77 Certainly, the constant flow of businessmen, soldiers, and civil servants to and from the colonies meant that
it would have been much more likely for enthusiasts of modest means to encounter
African objects of a type that struck them as potentially “authentic” in the flea markets
and antique shops of Paris than it would have been in the United States, where
such objects appeared only as high-priced rarities in art galleries. The Paris Colonial
Exposition of 1931 further intensified popular interest in African sculpture.78 It was
no accident, for example, that the French Equatorial Africa Pavilion at the 1931
Exposition included a “special vitrine devoted to art ne`gre,” which “showed the differences
between authentic pieces of native art and those made en se´rie for export,”
presumably to prevent aspiring collectors from being duped into buying allegedly
inferior objects.79 By 1935, therefore, an appreciation of traditional African sculpture
had already become a nostrum of progressive French taste. At the same time,
the discipline of cultural anthropology in France underwent a profound shift, developing
a new attitude toward the systematic use of data gathered through fieldwork.

The key agents in this transformation were the Institut d’ethnologie, founded
by Lucien Le´vy-Bruhl, Marcel Mauss, and Paul Rivet in 1925, and the Muse´e ethnographique
du Trocade´ro, as reformed in 1928 by Rivet and Georges-Henri Rivie`
re.80 These institutions, as James Clifford has shown, provided training, financial
support, and publicity for the work of Africanist anthropologists such as Marcel
Griaule and Michel Leiris, who redefined the field in the 1930s.81 As a result of these
twin developments—growing cultural acceptance and an expansion of ethnographic
literature—French-language commentary on African art began to change, developing
a more fine-grained sense of the original contexts in which sculptures were
produced.82
