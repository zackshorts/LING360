Stieg Larsson (1954–2004), author of the famous Millennium Trilogy crime novels, declared that SF exhibited “some of the most politically progressive writing” to be found anywhere.72 Richard Luckhurst, reviewing the British Library’s SF exhibition Out of this World: Science fiction but not as you know it, suggested that “It is better… to think science fiction is less about futurology than a device for ‘Othering’ the present. It defamiliarises the contemporary world, often for satirical or political ends.”73 Nalo Hopkinson and Uppinder Mehan state that authors interested in postcolonialism and SF have been playing with the theme of colonisation for this very purpose, namely: to “critique it, pervert it, fuck with it, with irony, with anger, with humour, and also, with love and respect for the genre of science fiction that makes it possible to think about new ways of doing things.”74 While Avatar, given its Orientalist stereotyping, might not be as politically progressive as Cameron had intended, the film has taken on a political life of its own. Like Antonio Gramsci’s concept of hegemony, culture has the potential to sustain the status quo as well as to evolve also into “a site of struggle, as plural subjects under the sway of [this] hegemony… assert their multifarious and contradictory forms of social consciousness.”75 This is especially true given the way in which Avatar’s storyline and meanings have been appropriated globally by the victims of other colonial injustices. 
In India, the Dongria Kongh who number about eight thousand and who “have left the trees on the mountain [where they reside] untouched as they believe that a god inhabits the forest,” have utilized the film a way to gain public attention to their plight against the mining company Vedanta.76 At the start of 2010, Palestinian protesters in the village of Bil’in near Ramallah dressed as Na’vi characters to gain global attention to their opposition to Israel’s separation barrier. In China bloggers have suggested that the government’s near total ban on Avatar was not only a way to protect the Chinese film industry (the official statement) but also a reflection of the authorities’ concern that the film’s focus on relocation might incite rebellion amongst the tens of thousands of Chinese being forced to make way for massive hydro electric projects. In addition, Chinese leaders might have perceived the film’s storyline as problematic or provocative considering that nation’s history of contested occupation in Tibet and Xinjiang. In Canada too, the film has been used by critics of Alberta’s tar sands projects who have drawn direct comparisons between Shell, BP and Exxon and the RDA. Full-page adverts in North American publications have talked about “Canada’s avaTAR Sands.”77 In a case of life imitating art, the Ayoreo tribe in Brazil have taken to attacking a local company’s bulldozers whose machines are being used to cut down trees in the rainforest to make way for ranchers.78 On one environmental listserv they were reports that “audiences as far apart as Brazil and Malaysia left theatres energized and mobilized, discussing imperialism, globalization, capitalism, struggles over natural resources, and modes of resistance.”79 “Decolonising Pandora” is itself a product of such a discussion amongst students in an undergraduate history class on empire.
