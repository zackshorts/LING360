i have a batch script, and i need it to find duplicate pictures then to only keep one of them (Keeping the oldest one)
I didn't really find anything to work with since name and time of creation are different, sometime even the resolution is different
since i want to check for duplicate in subfolder, i have this little piece of code
@echo off
FOR /D /R %%d IN (*.*) DO (
cd %%d
[the place where i need to remove duplicates]
)

I want to have multiple files with the same picture and to only keep one, but i'm missing the crucial part of code that can find if picture are the same of not
