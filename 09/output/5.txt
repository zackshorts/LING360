If you run the below code snipper, the results of the for-loop and that of the functional filter().map() approach is not the same.
What did I do wrong with the functional approach and what is the functional approach of that for-loop if my method is completely wrong?


var data_obj_arr = [{"Size": "<1000", "Type": "Detached", "Location": "Northern", "Configuration": "Downflow", "Age": "Built Before 1980", "Collection_Name": "test"}, {"Size": "<1000", "Type": "Detached", "Location": "Northern", "Configuration": "Downflow", "Age": "Built Before 1980", "Collection_Name": "test"}, {"Size": "<1000", "Type": "Detached", "Location": "Northern", "Configuration": "Downflow", "Age": "Built Before 1980", "Collection_Name": "test"}]


    function updateChosenOption(category_choice, category) {

        var arr = [];
        for (let i in data_obj_arr) {
            if (data_obj_arr[i][category] === category_choice) {
                arr.push(data_obj_arr[i]["Collection_Name"]);
            }
        }

        console.log(`Array: ${arr}`);

        var results = data_obj_arr.filter((el => el[this.curr_category] === category_choice), {curr_category: category} )
        .map(el => el["Collection_Name"]);

        console.log(`Results: ${results}`);        
    }
        
        updateChosenOption('Built Before 1980','Age')

What are you expecting this.curr_category to be? Maybe you want data_obj_arr.filter((el => el[category] === category_choice)
