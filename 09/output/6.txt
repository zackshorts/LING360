The reportNewIncomingCall completion argument isn't being called, which means that I'm not getting any feedback as to why my VOIP app isn't displaying the call receiving alert.    
    func reportIncomingCall(uuid: UUID, handle: String, hasVideo: Bool = false, completion: ((NSError?) -> Void)?) {
    // 1.
    let update = CXCallUpdate()
    update.remoteHandle = CXHandle(type: .phoneNumber, value: handle)
    update.hasVideo = hasVideo

    // 2.
    provider.reportNewIncomingCall(with: uuid, update: update) { error in
        if error == nil {
            // 3.
            let call = Call(uuid: uuid, handle: handle)
            self.callManager.add(call: call)
        }

        // 4.
        completion?(error as? NSError)
    }
}

I am taking this from a Ray Wanderlich tutorial.
