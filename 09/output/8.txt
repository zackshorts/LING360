How to save the result of running a python in a ipynb file?

I'm a beginner of Python and want to use a Python file in an ipynb file to convert some experimental data. The python file is on the GitHub https://github.com/andygock/Thermocouple.
This my code.
%run -i C:/Users/.../tc --mode mv2k 

I could only run the file and get a result, but I couldn't save the value like: 
 X = %run -i C:/Users/.../tc --mode mv2k 

I tried to use:
command = 'python C:/Users/...tc.py --mode mv2k'
r = os.popen(command) 
info = r.readlines()

But as the input data is an array, I can not add a variable into command.
Do you have any suggestions? Thanks!
