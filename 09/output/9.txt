Display On Sale Products

I am trying to use the method described in this answer (https://stackoverflow.com/a/28375823/235648) to create a paginated display of on sale products in my Wordpress Woocommerce site.
I have this line in my pre_get_posts hook: $q->is_post_type_archive = true;
If I keep this line as is, the page shows the 'Shop by Category' display (not the on sale items).
I discovered that if I change it to false it does display all the on sale items, but in an expanded view, I want to display it as a tabular product view, as in the rest of the shop.
What is going on?
Thanks!

Did you adjust the $sale_page_id = 487; to suit your site?

Yep, and i also put some echo statements in the innermost blocks to make sure my code was actually running.

Well I had to ask. :) What version of WC are you running? My code is kind of old, it could be that it doesn't work any longer.

In WordPress Admin, click Pages->Add New
Create a page called "On Sale" 
The Page contents should be as follows: 
[sale_products per_page="12"]

Voila!  You now have a page showing products on sale.
